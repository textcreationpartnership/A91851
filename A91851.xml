            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Introductions to the Whole Body of</hi> MEDICINE.</head>
               <head type="sub">Medicine is a Science unravelling the Diſpoſitions of Mans Body, for the Conſervation of preſent Health, and the Reſtitution of it being loſt.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Controverſie hath been with much heat moved among Authors, concerning the determination of the Genus of <hi>Medicine;</hi> which being for the moſt part conjectural, and aiming at a certain end, <hi>viz.</hi> the acquiſition or conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Health, it ſeems to be fitly rank'd in the number of Arts. But becauſe it ſtands upon the Baſis of its proper Principles, Actions and Demonſtrations, raiſed upon natural, and ſome of which are more evident than Natural Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being intruſted to the apprehenſions of Senſe, and having one reall Subject, exiſting of it ſelf and excellent above others, <hi>viz.</hi> Mans body, whoſe proprieties it unmasketh; it ſeems in all reaſon more aptly to be related to the Sciences. To which opinion I rather incline, for the knowledg of Arts is acquired only by frequentation of practice, in which they are wholly imployed, and the habit of Medicine, as true Sciences, is gained by cuſtomary ſtudy, and inſtruction of learned Men: Nor can any Art be produced, which by Actions and Principles demonſtrates the paſſions and proprieties of its ſubject as Medicine doth; For though it be in ſome part conjectural; and delivers ſome precepts which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wide of certainty: This is no argument or ground for us to imagine it related to the Arts, for by this means Natural Philoſophy ſhould be referred to the Arts alſo; becauſe of the conjectural probation of many things, by reaſon that their true cauſes are not brought under perfect knowledg. Now the end which it intends is diſcerned by the method of its inſtitution, as <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſaeus</hi> hath well obſerved; For Medicine falls under the notion of a double conſideration: Firſt, Either as it is taught by ſure ſolid and indubitable principles, and thus it hath no leſs right to the name of a Science, than Aſtrology, Geometry, or Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, being able to traffick upon her own ſingle ſtock. Or ſecondly, as it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the benefit of Men, as Aſtrology to the conſtitution of hours, Geometry to the commenſuration of the Earth, Arithmeticke to numerical computations. And Medicine thus conſidered ſteers to the moſt beneficial and excellent and of all.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153522:13"/>But yet leſt I ſhould ſeem too obſtinate in the defence of mine own opinion, I ſay, Medicine may entertain the appellation of Science in a wider ſenſe, which Ariſtotle in the <hi>ſecond Book of his Metaphyſicks and the ſecond Chapter</hi> propoſeth; as it comprehends ſciences ſpeculative and practical, but yet in ſuch method that ſciences practical are diſtinguiſhed from true Arts.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Subject of Medicine is Mans body as Curable.</head>
                  <p>In every ſubject of ſciences there are required four qualifications, two relating to the ſubject it ſelf, two to the ſcience. Firſt, as to the ſubject, 'tis requiſite, that it comprehend all thoſe things which are propoſed in the ſcience. Secondly, that it give unity and ſpecification to the ſcience, that from thence may be ſpun a definition. But as to the ſcience 'tis neceſſary that it make no digreſſion to any thing, which is not its object, or conſequential to it. Next, that it unravel the cauſes, paſſions and proprieties of its ſubject, as Ariſtotle proves <hi>in the fourth book of his Metaphyſicks Chapter the firſt:</hi> All which do ſo evidently appear in Mans body, that it may without exception deſervedly be called the true Subject of Medicine. <hi>It may be objected,</hi> that Medicine doth not only treat of Mans body, but alſo of things natural, not natural, and preternatural, and ſo circles almoſt the whole Creation, as plants, animals, minerals, and what ever elſe is comprehended in the large extent of the univerſe, may be termed the ſubject of Medicine. <hi>To this I Anſwer,</hi> that a Phyſician handles not theſe things ſimply and in themſelves, but as they bear a relation to Mans body, as they may be prejudicial or commodious for it, and theſe things are termed <hi>the ſubject of contemplation,</hi> but mans body <hi>the ſubject of reduction,</hi> viz. to which all other things are reduced.</p>

                  <head>But the End is Health.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> calls that the end in the acquiſition of which the Artiſt reſteth, becauſe no action ſtarts forward to infinity, but is at length brought to ſome perfection, in which the Agent doth acquieſce, which he is alwayes intent to attain, which is the ſcope of all precedent actions; and this perfection is called the end, which in Medicine is Sanity, to which all Medicinal operations are directed, which being attained the Phyſician ſits down for company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Some again may object,</hi> That Medicine being as to its <hi>genus</hi> a Science practical, whoſe end is action, as Contemplation of Sciences ſpeculative, the end of Medicine is not rightly plac'd in reſt. <hi>I Anſwer to this,</hi> That there is <hi>one ultimate end,</hi> to which the reſt are ſubordinate, but there are more <hi>intermediate ends,</hi> which are actions previous to the arriving to that end: to theſe we referre when we conſtitute action the end of practical Science.</p>

                  <p>The firſt ſenſible principles which are the foundation of the fabrick of Mans body are the firſt elements of all things, from the various permiſtion of which there reſults a various temper; various Humors have a dependence upon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, upon the Humors Spirits, which preſerve and make vigorous the natural Heat. To the Humors Spirits and natural Heat all the parts owe their production and ſuſtenance, all which cannot be effected without the help of the Soul, which being richly furniſhed with faculties, compleates all theſe operations, and is the firſt mover in the conſervation and primary generation of the whole Man.

                  <head type="sub">Elements are Simple bodies, out of which all others are compounded, and into which they are at laſt reſolved.</head>
                  <p>ELements are called <hi>ſimple bodies,</hi> becauſe they are not compounded of other bodies of a divers ſpecies, but only of Matter and Form, which are the firſt principles of all things, yet are not bodies. The Elements therefore are the firſt Simple bodies, and the ingredients to the compoſition of all others; for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of knowledg to find a body perfectly mixt which comprehends not in it ſelf the ſubſtance of the four Elements, which is evidently viſible in our bodies, which are compounded of four Humors of ſtrait affinity to the nature of the four Elements; but this is more clearly manifeſted from the diſſolution of mixt bodies, which thereupon flow again into Elements (as it is aſſerted in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition) for example, in the combuſtion of Wood, part thereof is converted into Aire, as it appeareth by ſmoak, which abundantly ſtreaming from it, is changed into aire, part alters into water, ſweating out at both ends, part into earth by aſhes, which are of a terrene Nature, laſtly part thereof is tranſmuted into fire, as it is apparently demonſtrated by the coals and flame. But though many bodies in their corruption have not ſtraightway an immediate tranſition into Elements, but by a kind of viciſſitude inveſt themſelves in other ſubſtances, yet they at length in their ultimate reſolution, retire into thoſe Elements out of which they were conflated, as it appears in our Food, which in Mans body firſt is changed into Chyle, then into blood, and next into the ſubſtance of the body, which after Death is reſolved into Elements, but part of this aliment degenerates into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, which in their dregs partly repreſent Earth, partly Water in Sweat and Urine, partly Fire and Aire in Steams, which inſenſibly leave the body being habitually diſpoſed to ſuch tranſpiration.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Elements are four; Earth, Water, Aire, and Fire.</head>
                  <p>SOme of the ancient Philoſophers held the Elements to be infinite, whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Firſt Book of the Heavens</hi> convinceth; others contracted the Elements into one only, whom <hi>Hipocrates in his Book of Humane Nature</hi> confutes by the force of this indiſſoluble Argument; <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>man were conſtituted by one Element, he would not be ſenſible of any pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon which confirms this conſequence is this, becauſe what ever Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize in pain, partake of the ſame ſenſe, and are alterable, but contrariety is the cauſe of every alteration; if therefore there were but one Element, there could not exiſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153522:14"/>any contrariety, becauſe nothing is contrary to it ſelf, and whatſoever ſuffers, the paſſion thereof proceeds from another thing.</p>
                  <p>But the cauſe why we preciſely oblige our ſelves to four Elements, appears by the firſt qualities, which being four are very diſtinct one from another, to wit, Calidity, Frigidity, Humidity and Siccity, which being accidents, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary every of them ſhould have its particular diſtinct and ſeparate ſubject. Nor can it be concluſively objected, that there are but two Elements, becauſe calidity with ſiccity, and frigidity with humidity are coupled together in one and the ſame body; For if from hence we gather that there are two Elements; Calidity being linck'd with Humidity, and Frigidity with Siccity, we may gather that there are two more: beſides the probation of four Elements is ſenſibly confirmed by the diſſolution of mixt bodies, which are reſolved into thoſe four firſt bodies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aſſertion of the preceedent Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>The Active are thoſe, which have chief efficacy in the mutual altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elements, and in the conſtitution of mixture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THeſe are not nominated <hi>Active ſimply</hi> and abſolutely, as ſome were of opinion, becauſe they only act, the reſt being purely paſſive; but this diſtinction is cauſed only by <hi>Compariſon,</hi> becauſe the Action of them is more efficacious than of thoſe others which are termed <hi>Paſſive,</hi> for that they are more Paſſive than Active, though they be not wholly deſtitute of action, for Humidity acts upon Siccity, Siccity upon Humidity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And theſe Actives are Calidity and Siccity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calidity is the firſt Active Quality; the effect of which is the congregating of things Homogeneous, and diſſipating of Heterogeneous, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>in his ſecond Book</hi> of generation.</p>
                  <p>Logicians terme thoſe things <hi>Homogeneous,</hi> which partake of the ſame nature and ſpecies, <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> which are of diverſe Species, which underſtanding cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with this diſcourſe; for Heat in the generation of a mixt body, doth not only congregate things <hi>Homogeneous</hi> but <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> moiſt with dry, which differ in Species.

                     <hi>And there are other proprieties of heat, viz. Reſolution, Operation, Inciſion, Maturation, and Attenuation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nature is infinitely ſtored with examples of theſe proprieties, but they are more apparent in the matter of Medicaments, which by the vertue of them are very efficacious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frigidity is a firſt active quality which muſters together things Homogeneous and Heterogeneous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So water with water, wax with wax, and any other thing adhering or incident to them, as Straws, Stone, Wood, Sand, Chaffe, and other things are coagmented together by conglaciation; till by Heat diſſolving this combination they are ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The work of Frigidity is to allay Heat to a due temperament, leſt the mixt body ſhould be over-Heated to a diſſolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This quality doth not only rally together things Homogeneous and Heterogeneous, but alſo fixeth them to adſtriction, condenſation, obſtruction, and incraſſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cold being contrary to Heat intailes a neceſſity to the contrary production of effects, nor muſt we comply with <hi>Cardan,</hi> who is of opinion that cold is meerly the abſence and privation of Heat, and nothing poſitive; which <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſeems to intimate, who ſayes, that cold is no ingredient to the operations of Nature. But <hi>Scaliger</hi> learnedly oppoſeth them both, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 22. And before his time <hi>Averroes,</hi> whoſe aſſertion, that cold is requiſite in the works of nature, is eſtabliſhed upon the baſis of two reaſons, firſt by tempering the Heat; next by operating in things a conſiſtency and coherence of parts; which cannot be effected by Heat whoſe propriety is diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus much of the Active qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Paſſive are thoſe which are leſs Active, and therefore in the mixtion of bodies are ſubordinate to the Active. And they are Humidity and Siccity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humidity is a Paſſive quality, whoſe effect is to make things exorbitant as to their own bounds, but eaſily confined to the limitation of another, Ariſt.</hi> 2. gene.</p>
                  <p>So water, wine, oyl and other humid bodies diffuſe themſelves, and can only be contained within the bounds of veſſels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Siccity is a paſſive quality making things to be eaſily content with their own limits, but impatient to be bounded by any other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So wood, ſtones and other ſuch like things, do obſtinately hold their proper figure, nor eaſily receive the impreſſion of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It may be objected,</hi> that fire which is highly dry is not confined within its own but rather ſome aliene boundary; which may alſo be affirmed of duſt and aſhes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which I oppoſe,</hi> that this is by accident and not naturally contingent to fire, becauſe of the tenuity of its ſubſtance, which will not admit ſuch cohibition, for there muſt be a copulation of Siccity with ſome denſity, that this deſcription may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be applyed to a ſubſtance. But duſt and aſhes in conſervation retain their proper figure: for they are not a body continued, but a contiguity of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts of the earth, which by reaſon they are ſo exile can be entertained in any place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe four firſt qualities are found in the Elements, as they can in poſſibility comply. For we meet with Calidity and Siccity in Fire, Calidity and Humidity in Air, Frigidity and Humidity in Water, Frigidity and Siccity in Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inherence and conjunction of theſe firſt qualities, are at large diſputed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153522:15"/>with much opiniative Heat of controverſy by Profeſſors in Phyſick, to whom for brevity ſake we referre the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus farre concerning firſt qualities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond qualities are thoſe which immediately reſult from the temperature and mixtion of the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this deſcription we caſheer from the ſecond qualities, colours, ſmel, and taſte, which are not the immediate effects of the firſt, nor ſo manifeſtly, but more remotely and obſcurely depend upon them. For this cauſe ſome, though not ſignificantly, place them in ſubordination by the terme of third qualities. In which if there be any difficulty the enucleation thereof muſt be referred to the doctrine of the Senſes, becauſe without theſe perſpectives they cannot be brought under a right underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe are fourteen,</hi> viz. <hi>Rarity and Denſity, Gravity and Levity, Hardneſſe and Softneſſe, Subtility and Craſſity, Aridity and Lubricity, Friability and Clammineſs, Aſperity and Laevity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rarity is a ſecond quality produced chiefly by Heat, by which things are extenuated to a poſſibility of diſſipation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Water by the Heat of the Sun is attenuated, thin, and diſſipable: ſo clouds eaſily pierced by the rayes of the Sun, are uſually termed rare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis worth obſervation,</hi> that rarity is twofold, one, which conſiſts in the tenuity of ſubſtance: and this is properly reduced to the Predicament of quality, accompanying Heat as the effect thereof, and ſo the aire is thin, the earth thick. The other conſiſts not in the tenuity of ſubſtance, but in the remoteneſs of parts, ſo we call a ſpunge rare, becauſe of thoſe intervalls and diſtances of the parts which lodge the aire: and this Rarity takes place in the Predicament of Site, and is, though better underſtood by us, more improperly termed Rarity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Denſity is a ſecond quality ariſing from Cold, by which things become more compact, firme, and with difficulty diſſipable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So water congealed by cold, ſo ſtones and metalls are denſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gravity is a quality produced by cold and denſity, by which things tend downwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levity is a quality produced from Heat and rarity, by vertue of which things make upwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hardneſſe is a quality ariſing from Siccity, by which things yield not eaſily to the touch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Softneſs is a quality ariſing from humidity, which renders things tangible without a repulſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Subtility is the production of Heat, Siccity, and Rarity, by which things are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated and fitted for penetration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It differs from rarity, as the effect from its cauſe; rarity being the Procatarctick of ſubtility. But not all rare things are ſubtile, for there is rarity in the aire, but no ſubtility, and ſome aire is craſſe; ſo by our advice our patients remove from groſs aire, which in many diſeaſes is not good to breath in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Craſſity is a quality which owes its being to cold, and denſity, by which things become Solid and leſs fit for penetration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Craſſity is differenced from denſity, as the effect from its cauſe, for all denſe bodies cannot properly be termed craſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aridity is a quality generated by Siccity, which baniſheth almoſt all humor. Lubricity is a quality flowing from humidity, by which things being rendred ſlippery deceive the touch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a Snake, and a way conglaciated is ſlippery.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:153522:16"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friability is a quality ariſing from Siccity, by which things for want of coherency may eaſily be crumbled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſalt and ſugar are friable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clammineſs is a quality ariſing from humidity, which cauſeth things to be ſticking and glutinous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So pitch, glue and other ſuch like things are called ſticking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſperity is a quality iſſuing from Siccity, by which the ſuperficies of things is unequal, and not tangeable without offence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the barks of Trees and pumices are offenſive by their aſperity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levity is a quality ariſing from humidity, by which things being of an even ſuperficies are pleaſing to the touch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This quality is not the effect of humidity only, but may alſo be artificially produced, when the rudeneſſe of things ſolid and denſe is poliſhed and plained.</p>

                  <p>BY <hi>Miſcibles</hi> are underſtood Elements which are diſpoſed to commixtion by a mutual alteration, and reduction to ſuch a temper, that they may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one. From which union ſprings a new form, which is termed the form of a mixt body: for example, when ſeeds of divers plants, are ſo mingled that there remains a poſſibility of ſeparation, this is called <hi>appoſition;</hi> but when water and wine or ſuch other things are mixed, ſo that the union cannot be parted, and yet no new form produced, this is called <hi>Confuſion.</hi> And both of theſe are improperly termed mixtion.</p>
                  <div type="conditions">
                     <head>Four Conditions are requiſite to produce mixtion.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>The Miſcibles muſt be contrarily qualified, that they may be fit for mutual action and paſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the things mixed did not mutually act one on the other, they could not be reduced to a due temper, whoſe ſpawne mixtion is, and by that means they would not be moved from their former ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>A juſt proportion of Miſcibles is neceſſary as well for quantity as for quality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if one exceed in quantity or quality, that will deſtroy the reſt, and appropriate them to its own nature, hence will ariſe the generation of one, and the corruption of the reſt, but no mixtion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>While the Elements are mixed, they muſt be minc'd into very ſmal particles, that every iota of the mixt body may comprehend in it ſelf the four Elements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This unition is cauſed by nature, which by making the Elements penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fits them for a mutual incurſion, that ſo the tranſmutation may be the eaſier.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>The forms of the Elements muſt remain in mixt bodyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This cauſeth a difference between <hi>generation</hi> and <hi>mixtion;</hi> for in generation by the acceſſion of a new form the precedent are corrupted; but in mixtion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153522:16"/>the new form produced, together with the conſtitutive form of the mixt bodies, dwell peaceably under the ſame roofe. The truth of which may hence be aſſerted, becauſe the form is author of all action; but the skirmiſh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities in mixt bodies, of which their deſtruction is the conſequence, cannot be cauſed by their form; for by this meanes it would be treacherous to it ſelf, and acceſſary to its own deſtruction, which runs counter to true Philoſophy. This implies a neceſſity of its dependence upon the formes of the Elements, and ſo that the Elements remain formally in mixt bodies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This affords matter of objection;</hi> That if a mixt body admits of plurality of forms, it loſes its unity of being, for of many actuall beings, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe one being by it ſelf, as Ariſtotle in the 2. <hi>of his Metaph.</hi> but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally aggregate, but the form gives an actual being to every thing. For the delumbation of this argument, <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> that this is true, if we level the vertue of forms into an equality, ſo that no one may Lord it over the reſt; but in mixt bodies there is a herauldry, one form being nobler than another: which is the form of the mixt body it ſelf, to the commands of which the forms of the Elements, comming ſhort of it in perfection, pay the tribute of obedience, and comparatively to it they are as the Matter, though in relation to the Matter of the Elements, they are true forms. Which that we may the more eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, we muſt know, that the Elements are conſidered in a double relation, either in relation which they bear to the <hi>Materia prima,</hi> out of which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated with their proper forms; or <hi>to that body,</hi> whoſe matter they are; in the firſt conſideration they are ſaid to have an actual being, in the latter a potential only.</p>
                     <p>For as in Logical predication, the intermediate <hi>genus</hi> is in regard of its inferiors a <hi>genus,</hi> of its ſuperiors a <hi>ſpecies;</hi> ſo in the eſſence of things, there are ſome mediate acts, which compared to the precedent matter may be called actual, which in reſpect of a compleater compoſition are only potential. Now though the forms of Elements in compariſon to the form of a mixt body are as matter and only potential, yet in reſpect of the matter of which the Elements are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they are alwayes actual and continually labouring to alter the matter, that they may retreat into their former nature, and be ſet at liberty, but the form of the mixt body, according to its authority quels and ſuppreſſes theſe active tumults for the better ſecuring of its preſervation, till they ſummon in external cauſes as Auxiliaries to invade the honour and diſloyally ſhake off the yoke of this noble form and ſo procure the deſtruction of the mixt body. I might enlarge in the explanation of this knotty and intricate Theoreme, but in which I have been brief, becauſe as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf <hi>in the firſt book of the Elements</hi> affirms, it is very little conducible to Medicine. Here therefore <hi>I will put a period to the firſt ſection.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Temperament is a proportion of the four Principal Qualities reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the mixtion of the Elements, for the due performance of operations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Temperament</hi> retains to mixtion as the effect to its cauſe, ariſing from that mutual contemperation of the firſt qualities, which produceth that due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion requiſite to the execution of all actions: but it is called <hi>proportion,</hi> as being a relation, which the qualities ſo tempered mutually bear to themſelves, not a quality differing from the four firſt, as <hi>Avicenna</hi> fanſyed, whoſe opinion <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> copiouſly confutes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It may be objected;</hi> That if Temperament be a relation, the actions ſhall have no dependence on it: becauſe relation hath no active vertue, nor can one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament be properly termed contrary to another, becauſe relation admits of no contrary. <hi>To this I Anſwer,</hi> That the Temperament acts not, by vertue of proportion, which is a relation, but of the foundation, on which this relation is eſtabliſhed, for the firſt qualities are laid as the baſis of this proportion, and upon theſe the actions do eſſentially depend, for the whole eſſence of the Temperament conſiſts not in the relation of the proportion, but neceſſarily imports ſuch a relation; as if we ſhould ſay, that Temperament were the firſt qualities reduced to a certain proportion.</p>

                  <p>BOdies ſo tempered that one quality exceeds the reſt, are ſaid to be of a ſimple Temperament, but when two qualities ſtand as it were in competition for ſupremacy over the reſt, they have a compounded Temperament; but when all the qualities are fixed to a due Mediocrity, they are then eſteemed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly tempered.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:153522:17"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence may ariſe an objection,</hi> That the firſt eight differences of Temperaments are cauſed by ſome predominant Element, or at leaſt in our bodies by ſome predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Humor; hence ſome Temperaments are termed bilious, ſome pituitous, and ſo of the reſt; but every Element is fortified with two qualities, by whoſe exceſs the conſequence of theirs is neceſſary; humors alſo haue two predominant qualities; therefore there can be no ſimple Temperament, but all are compound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this I oppoſe.</hi> That in mixtion or alteration there may poſſibly be ſuch a concurrence of the Elements, that one quality may be broken, when the other is in exceſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> if Aire and Fire exceed, the humidity of the one will temper the Siccity of the other, but when both are hot, they will cauſe an exceſs of heat; ſo it fares with humors, for the Siccity of Choler tempers the humidity of the blood, but when both are hot they inflame to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy of heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Temperaments are ſaid to be ſuch, either abſolutely or comparatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abſolutely ſuch are thoſe in which one or two qualities are predominant, which afford them a denomination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Fire is abſolutely hot, water cold; ſo all perfect animals are abſolutely hot, becauſe of the predominancy of Heat in them, for Heat is the vigour of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comparatively ſuch are thoſe, in which theſe qualities do more or leſſe exceed, then in thoſe with which they are compared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a man in relation to a Fiſh is hot, to a Lion cold; the brain cold in reſpect of the heart: from whence it appears, that one and the ſame thing is comparatively cold, which notwithſtanding is abſolutely hot.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>A well mixt or moderate Temperament is twofold; one ballanced by Weight, the other by Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moderate according to Weight, is that in which the firſt qualities of the Elements are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch an accurate proportion, that one is not counterpoiſed by another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SOme term that a body tempered according to Weight, in which there is not onely found an equal proportion of Qualities, but of Elements alſo, which is an impoſſibility in Nature, and not comprehenſible by Fancy, for Immobility is the neceſſary attendant thereof, every mixt body ſteering by the motion of its predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Element; nor would any find its proper place, for every thing naturally hath a ſtation, which is proper to ſuch predominant Element. We muſt therefore underſtand it onely of qualities equally mixed, which whether there be any ſuch thing in Nature, is with ſome diſputable; who are of opinion, that it was by Authors conſtituted, onely to repreſent as an <hi>Idea</hi> a perfect Temperament, and to be the rule and ſquare of the reſt, that by compariſon we might paſs the better judgement of their exceſs; As <hi>Plato</hi> hath modelled ſuch a perfect Common-wealth, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſuch a perfect Orator, and the Stoicks ſuch a perfect Sage, as never were in being. And <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf <hi>in his firſt Book of the Preſervation of Health, Chap.</hi> 5. affirms, that ſuch a Mediocrity is not eaſily found. And if any one ſhould acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally meet with it, it will eſcape the quickeſt ſtroke of the underſtanding, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting not the leaſt diviſibility of time without variety of change. It is therefore rather imaginable then truely ſubſiſting, eſpecially being not ſo conducible to the exerciſe of various acts, as that which is called Temperament according to Juſtice, as it ſhall after appear.</p>
                  <p>It is called Temperament according to Weight, becauſe it conſiſts of the juſt meaſure, and at it were, ballance of Elements, which is not ground enough to make this denomination proper. Philoſophers call it <hi>Temperament according to Arithmetical proportion;</hi> becauſe, as in Arithmetical proportion there is a parity in numbers, or in the diſtances of the numbers, ſo that there is no larger <hi>interſtitium</hi> from 2 to 3, then from 3 to 4: So in this Temperament there is a kind of parity in the qualities, ſo that one is equal to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Temperament is called Moderate according to Juſtice, in which the firſt qualities of the Elements are ſo apportioned, that every thing according to its ſpecies is fitted for the execution of its proper actions.</hi> Things different in <hi>ſpecies,</hi> differ in Functions, and all the Functions of every thing depend upon the Temperament, therefore it is neceſſary that their Temperaments be various, whereby that may incline to ſuch variety of action; ſo that in one body Heat maſters Cold, in another Humidity reigns over Siccity, for differing tempers are required to execute the operations of a Man, a Lion, and an Horſe, and ſo forth. And this is called a Temper according to Juſtice; for as Juſtice ſcatters not her favours, nor inflicts her penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties equally on all, but according to the dictates of Reaſon, proportions to ſome more, to ſome leſs; by which diſparity of diſtribution, there appears much equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Juſtice: So the juſtice of Nature lends divers Temperaments to things diſtinct in <hi>ſpecies,</hi> by the help of which they may be enabled to a compleat and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153522:18"/>perfect execution of thoſe duties to which they are by Nature deſigned. This is called by the Philoſophers, <hi>a Temperament according to a Geometrical proportion;</hi> for as in Geometrical proportion we examine not the equality of Difference but of Reaſon; ſo in this Temperament, we weigh not the proportion of theſe qualities by the ballance, but by their apt congruity and acommodateneſs to the nature of every <hi>ſpecies.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>All the differences of Temperaments are perceptible by the Touch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ALL thoſe differences rely upon the exceſs of the firſt qualities, which are the object of the ſenſe of touching, as Colours of Seeing, Sapors of Taſting, and Odors of Smelling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The organ of Touch is the Skin, which chiefly we have at our fingers ends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An organ adapt for the diſquiſition of the exceſs of all qualities, muſt have an inherent mediocrity of them all, and not lean to a partiality. This is the Skin of a well-tempered Man, in which reſides an equal portion of ſeed and blood, which cauſe a moderate Temperament, parts wholly Carnous being hot and moyſt, Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick cold and dry: But that the exceſs of qualities may be perceptible by the Skin, it muſt enjoy its natural temper, free from the overballancings of any one quality; for inſtance, if it be almoſt congealed with cold, it is uncapable of this office. The skin of the Hand is better qualified for it then of any other part, not that extended over the palm, becauſe of the hard tendon which lurks under it, which being condenſed by continual attrition, becomes callous, but that which terminates the fingers, as retaining uſually its natural conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Skin hath a poſitive ſenſe of the inequality and exceſs of Temperaments, but a privative of their quality and moderation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Senſe comes by Paſſion, and all Paſſion by Contrariety, but the Exceſs of Tempers ſtands in contrariety to the Moderation of them; by this means they do really and poſitively affect a temperate skin; but a moderate temper being not heightned to an exceſs of qualities, therefore not affecting the Touch falls onely under the underſtanding of Privation. For thoſe things which being neither hot nor cold, do no way affect the Senſe, becauſe of their congruity to it, are eſteemed temperate.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THough the umpeerage in the determination of Temperaments is attributed to the Touch, yet we cannot abſolutely conclude it thus without an exception; for <hi>Galen in his third Book of the Temperaments,</hi> aſſerts Touch to be the abſolute Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator of Heat and Cold, but of Moiſt and Dry not ſimply, but by a rational
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153522:19"/>application, for Humidity cannot be known but by Softneſs, nor Siccity but by Hardneſs; but the Touch meets with many hard things void of Siccity, and with many ſoft things of Humidity. For a thing may be termed Hard three wayes, as <hi>Galen in the fifth Book of the Faculties of ſimple Medicaments, Chap.</hi> 4. affirms: by dryneſs, as is evident by the bones; by concretion, as in Ice, and other things condenſed by the force of cold; and by repletion, as in the bladder of men inflated with Hydropical tumors. Hence it appears that many things are hard, yet not dry; So many things natural dry, as Lead, when liquefied, ſeem to be ſoft: Hence we may gather, that theſe qualities will eaſily decoy the Touch by ſuch impoſtures, unleſs we take advice of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may ſpin from hence an <hi>Objection,</hi> That the ſame aſſertion will hold good of Heat and Gold; whereas of things Hot or Cold, ſome are ſo actually, ſome potentially; ſome in themſelves, others by accident; as Pepper is potentially very hot, yet being expoſed to the ſeverity of a nipping Winter, will repreſent it ſelf cold; and Water, which in it sown conſtitution is cold, by calefaction will be counted hot, becauſe it preſents it ſelf to the Touch. This may be a ground of no deſpicable doubts in paſſing judgement of them; unleſs we call Reaſon to the Bar, which may unriddle the myſtery of their natural conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>To this I <hi>reply;</hi> When we aſſert that the Touch onely is the great umpire of Cold and Heat, we principally underſtand this of the Temperament of the whole body, without any relation, which properly belongs to Reaſon. The like judgement may be paſſed of thoſe things which are ſuch in themſelves, not by accident; actually, not potentially: For as to theſe it will hold true to ſay, that the Touch is the true Judge of Heat and Cold, as they affect it being preſent; which is not contingent in things moiſt and dry, being repreſented to the Touch, not by themſelves, and immediately, but by the interceſſion of other qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Softneſs and Hardneſs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Tempers of the ſeveral Ages.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">An Age is a ſpace of life, by which with the concurrent action of the natural heat operating upon the Native moiſture, is produced an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mutation in the conſtitution of the Body.</head>
                  <p>WEE owe the conſervation of our life to natural heat, which uſeth the native moiſture as food, and by degrees preys upon it, the action of which calls a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, by which being debilitated by a kind of ſympathy, it moulders away, together with the moiſture: ſo that our bodies in the cradles of our life are abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heat and moiſture, which in the maturation of Time become cold and dry, and this gradation of Time which leads us forward to theſe mutations, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures out our lives, is called Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The principal differences of which are foure; <hi>1</hi> Puerility, <hi>2</hi> Youth, <hi>3</hi> Setled Age, <hi>4</hi> Old Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:153522:19"/>
                  <p>This whole continuity of life is ſignalized with four grand mutations, as it may be exemplified by all things, every thing having a beginning, growth, ſtature, and declination; therefore the whole age of man is divided by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> into four parts correſpondent to the number of the Elements, the ſeaſons of the yenr, the humors of our bodies, and their Temperaments, which is of ſpecial uſe to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. For though Lawyers and Aſtrologers for the better accommodating them to the doctrines of their Sciences, have made another diviſion of the Ages, this is little conſiderable, though in our Authors we meet with ſome ſubdiviſions of theſe Ages as we ſhall after ſhew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Puerility from its firſt bloſſome ſhoots out to twenty five, and is of conſtitution hot and moiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This bears a relation of ſimilitude to the ſpring, and of the humors to the blood, for both are judged to be hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This again crumbles into four parts; of which the firſt is termed</hi> Infancy, <hi>ſprouting to the fourth year, or according to the opinion of ſome to the ſeventh: the ſecond</hi> Puerility <hi>in progreſſe to the fourteenth year; the third,</hi> Youth, <hi>haſting to eighteen; the fourth</hi> Adoleſcency, <hi>terminated by twenty five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that interval whoſe extent is to twenty five, the moiſture is in a deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, therefore mans life was minced into theſe ſubdiviſions according to the proportion of that; but there happens a more notable change in youth then in the other diviſions, for then a downy chin is faſhionable from whence this Age took its appellation, then maidens breaſts are impregnate and their Moneths iſſue, and the voice of males is more full and rough; hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls them <hi>Goatiſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are then addicted to Venery, which is cauſed by the <hi>vigour</hi> of heat, which then breaks out of priſon from the humors, and begins to exert it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Youth ranges to thirty five or forty, and is hot and dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſet in compariſon with the ſummer and the bilious humor; for then heat is in the higheſt point of its horizon, which by its vehement action out of the aſhes of moiſture rouzeth up Siccity.</p>
                  <p>Here a <hi>Quere</hi> is made, whether youth be hotter then Puerility? <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> that boyes are extenſively hotter, youths intenſively; or boyes are hotter in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quantity, youths in reſpect of the quality. For this heat falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſideration both of ſubſtance, and quality, as to the quantity or copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſubſtance, there is greater plenty of it in boyes then in youths, for the leſſe we are diſtant from the womb of our natural principles, we are the more fertile in heat and moiſture. But as to the quality, heat is without doubt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe in youths, becauſe of their Siccity, which is the accompliſhment of heat: hence the heat in boyes is gentle, ſweet, and habituous, as being allayed to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration by the natural moiſture: but the heat of youths is biting, ſharp, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, by reaſon of ſharp vapors, which exhale out of dry bodyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtant Age dilates it ſelf to forty five or fifty, and is cold and dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is denominated <hi>conſtant</hi> Age, becauſe though there begins to be ſome diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrength, yet this change is not perceptible in any habit or action, but men ſo aged ſeem to be fixed in the ſame ſtation; this age is comparatively related to Autumn, and the Melancholick humor, which now abounds, becauſe of the ill cookery of Choler ſcorch'd in youth, which is now converted into Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Old Age puts a period to life, and is cold and moiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The temper of old men is two-fold, either according to the temper of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid parts, or the liberality of the excrements. As to the ſolid parts they are cold
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153522:20"/>and dry, becauſe of the great diminution of their native moiſture, by which means the parts are much dryed. But as to the excrements, which for want of heat are very copious in them, and are cold and moiſt; they are thence ſaid to be cold and moiſt alſo; which ſenſe we keep to, that we may not loſe the Analogy of the Ages with the ſeaſons of the year and the humors, and ſo old Age is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Winter, and to the pituitous humor, which in them is copious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this is ſubdivided into three parts. The firſt is called</hi> Old Age, <hi>extending from fifty to ſixty; the ſecond,</hi> Ingraveſcent Age, <hi>from ſixty to ſeventy: the third</hi> decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitneſs, <hi>from ſeventy to the concluſion of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men in <hi>the firſt entrance of old Age,</hi> are yet able enough to execute civill duties. In <hi>Ingraveſcent Age</hi> they are weaker and want more eaſe, but not a totall receſſe. But in <hi>Decrepit Age,</hi> being plundered of all ſtrength, there muſt be a totall ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from buſineſſe, they muſt be favorable to themſelves, and entertain only thoughts of futurity. But here we muſt take <hi>notice,</hi> that all theſe Ages are of a large extent according to the ſtrength or invalidity of mens conſtitutions, ſo that ſome are more ſenſible of the defects of Age at fifty then others at ſixty or more.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Males generally are Hot and Dry, Females Cold and Moiſt.</head>
                  <p>THE infallibility of this Theoreme will eaſily appear by the knowledge of thoſe ſigns which diſcover a Hot and Dry temper, which are deduced from the cauſes and effects of it. And firſt as to the cauſes; the ſeed (which in generation performs the duties of the efficient, and the matter) ingredient to the generation of Males is hotter then that, which produces Females. For acccording to <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the <hi>cloſet of Males is on the right.</hi> But it appears by Anatomical diſquiſition that the right veſſel which is the treaſure of ſeminal matter takes riſe from the bottom of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> by which means the ſeed is hotter; but the left is not derived from the very bottom, but from the <hi>emulgens ramus,</hi> which conveying the <hi>ſerum</hi> to the reins renders the ſeed more cold and ſerous.</p>
                  <p>Among the effects are numbred actions, excrements, and habitual accidents.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obvious and diſcernible to every eye, that by their animal actions males are hotter, they being much ſtronger, and of greater ability to labour, but females dull and ſlow, and not pleaſed but with delicacy. As to the vital actions, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the pulſe beating higher, and reſpiration being more vehement in males then in females, the voice fuller and more intenſe, is a pregnate ground of their greater heat, they are alſo better at natural exerciſe as appears by their excrements.</p>
                  <p>The excrements of Males are in quantity few, but plentiful in females, as may be inſtanced in their monthly purgations, which are cauſed by the inefficacy of heat to diſcuſſe all that blood which is generated in the Liver. But in Males all are ſo throughly digeſted, that there remains no ſuperfluity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the habit of the body is a plain demonſtration, that Males are much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for not only their Chin but their whole body is hairy, they are fortified with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153522:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>a hard and rough skin, they have large and dilated veins, and muſcles firm and well cemented, but females are ſmooth and weak, they have a skin ſoft to fluitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and narrower muſcles, and veſſels.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt not paſſe without <hi>an Aſterisk,</hi> it being worth notice, that the Theoreme expreſſeth, <hi>that Males are generally the hotter,</hi> becauſe this ſex is to be generally conſidered, and to be underſtood that for the moſt part the Males are the hotter, for ſome females there are, which are of a hot temper, exceeding ſome cold men, but becauſe this in both is beyond their ordinary conſtitution, it doth not therefore at all invalidate our aſſertion.</p>

                  <p>THeſe ſeaſons are chiefly father'd upon the Sun, which by his anniverſary motion cauſeth divers mutations in the air.

                     <p>The Spring begins then to peep forth when the Sun takes poſſeſſion in the ſign Aries, and heates the aire to a mediocrity, which as yet being not well armed accompanies the moiſture left by the precedent winter, which by degrees it maſters, ſo that the ſpring in its vigor is commonly temperate; it ſymbolizeth with the aire, and with a ſanguin and indifferent temper; according to <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> it is the moſt wholeſome of all ſeaſons, and the moſt fertile, for heat and moiſture heightens all things to a vigor and fertility. For though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> ſhews us a catalogue of many and dangerous diſeaſes which attend that ſeaſon, this takes not away the ſalubrity of it, for it is but an accident or contingency in ill mixt bodies, which in the winter have muſtered up a legion of vitiated humors, which are diffuſed by the ſucceeding warmth of the ſpring, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times putrify: but for wholeſome and ſound conſtitutions there is no better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative it keeps them in their proper temper, as repreſenting them, by a lively ſimilitude.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>An Humor is a fluid body, produced in us by the coction of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment, for better nutrition, or other advantage of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THis term <hi>Humor</hi> is uſed in a double ſenſe; <hi>Firſt,</hi> in its general and uſual acception it implies any thing, which is hardly contained by its own, but eaſily by the limitation of another, whether it be generated in our bodies, or not, and ſo all liquors are comprehended in the latitude of this underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> to draw it into a leſſer circle, to its proper and ſtrict ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion known to Phyſicians, it is taken for liquid bodies, which ſpring from the ſecond, and third coction, as appears by the definition; in which humor is called <hi>a fluid body,</hi> becauſe as other liquors, it eaſily diffuſeth it ſelf, and tranſgreſſeth its own bounds. 'Tis ſaid alſo <hi>to be generated in us by the coction of the aliment,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from other moiſtures, which may by divers inlets ſurpriſe our bodies without any alteration or change, and that we may know how theſe humors are generated in our body. For Nature being carefull of the preſervation of living creatures, and chiefly of man, invented divers wayes of nouriſhment fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with divers qualities, by which they might receive nouriſhment, and growth, not immediately, but by many preparative mutations; and ſo the aliments are firſt grinded in the mouth, then being ſent into the ſtomach, they are confuſed, concocted and converted into a kind of creamy ſubſtance, which is called Chyle: which Chyle being exactly cooked in the ſtomach is turned out into the inteſtines, and there the uſefull part of it is abſtracted from the earthy and uſeleſs matter, out of which is generated dung; but the purer part of it is conveyed to the Liver by the help of the Meſaraick veins, in which they are reconcocted and changed, from whence ſprings the fountaine of blood, which comprehends various dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of humors, of which we ſhall treat.</p>

                     <hi>The Primary are thoſe which are contained in the veins, retaining the impreſſe of that form which they borrowed from the Liver, and communicate themſelves with an indifferency to every member.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THey are called <hi>Primary,</hi> becauſe they are the womb of the <hi>Secundary,</hi> and alſo becauſe as ſoon as they are generated in the Liver, they then firſt entertain the name of humors; for Chyle with the Phyſicians is never termed an humor. But as long as the veins are the cloſet of theſe humors, they alwayes retain the ſame name and the form received in the Liver, till courſing through every part, they begin to be changed by them, then they reform themſelves, and get new names as in its ſeaſon ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <div type="humours">
                     <head>And they are Four; Blood, Flegme, Choler and Melancholy.</head>
                     <p>The portion of the Chyle which is defecated, ſtreams thorough the channel of the Meſaraick veins to the Liver, by whoſe heat it is concocted and changed, &amp; partakes ſomewhat of its nature, acquiring not only a ſcarlet dy, but a temper reſembling that of the Liver: but this ſubſtance after its mutation in the liver is called the <hi>Maſſe of blood</hi> wherewith it abounds, not that it is conflated of that only. For as every Agent though it act in the ſame method produceth different effects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the patient lies diſpoſed, as the Sun by the ſame heat, whitens lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen and browns the skin, hardens dirt and ſoftens wax; ſo our food being conflated of four Elements, the heat of the Liver which is the efficient in the generation of humors, changes the airy part of the aliment into blood, the fiery into choler, the watry into flegme, the earthy into melancholy. Though it cannot be impugned, but that the efficient conduceth much to the copious production of either humor, for a hotter Liver out of the ſame aliment makes more choler, then one cold; contrary to which a colder generates flegme more copiouſly. Yet the exceſſe can never ſwel to ſuch a diſproportion, but that out of every aliment there will iſſue alwayes theſe four humors, though not obliged to a juſt equality, which naturally ought ſo to be tempered, that there ſhould be greater plenty of blood, leſs of flegme, leſs yet of melancholy, and leaſt of all of choler. But that theſe four humors are contained in the maſſe of blood, 'tis evident from the variety of the parts of our body, which differing in temper, cannot all receive nutriment from one and the ſame humor, for nutriment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from ſimilitude. And ſo only conſidering the parts we may eaſily paſſe judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſubſtance of the milt is very like the melancholick humor; of the Lungs reſembling the bilious humor; of the Liver the Sanguin, of the brain the pituitous, and ſo that they attract nutriment from thence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Blood properly ſo called is the more temperate part of the whole maſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to heat and moiſture, and painted with red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE more temperate part of the Chyle, and indifferent in ſubſtance, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into blood properly ſo called, which is of affinity to the nature and temper of the Liver, which being hot and moiſt communicates its temper to a ſubſtance like to it ſelf, and it not only tempers, but dyes it red, in ſo deep a grain that it outvies the colour of other humors partaking of the ſame maſſe, ſo that the whole maſſe of humors is veſted in red, and in an abſolute term embraces the name of blood. Which that it might be plentiful theſe acceſſaries are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> temperate aliment, and of a good juice, the flower of Age, ſpring time, an hot and moiſt temper of the Liver.</p>
                  <p>Though blood proceeds from all aliment, yet ſome are more, others leſs copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the production of it: When therefore all theſe cauſes convene, from this concurrence will reſult a Sanguin Temperament, becauſe blood is very predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. It is uſefull for the nutrition of carnous parts, as of the muſcles and bowels which are nouriſhed by blood properly ſo called. The effect of it is to raiſe in men hilarity and mirth, a propenſity to ſports and love, and flouriſhes them with a lovely colour; becauſe they are well fraught with temperate heat, which is the original of theſe merry frolicks. As we may take notice that all creatures in the cradle of their Age, are much addicted to hilarity, becauſe that is the furnace of natural heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whatever blood confines it ſelf to the veines, is ſtockt with many fibres, by the benefit of which it acquireth concretion and aſſimulation with the parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Fibres,</hi> a great number of which the blood harbours, are manifeſtly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when the blood is tempered with much water, or ſtirred with the hand, as may be ſpecified in Swines blood, all the fibres following this agitation that may be an hindrance to concretion; for ſuch is the vertue of theſe fibres that they preſently rally to an unition with the blood which flowes out of the veins, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the propoſed examples. And by the help of theſe the blood, being conveyed to divers parts, for the better nutrition is condeſed and ſolidated, ſo that it may eaſily be aſſimilated to the parts, otherwiſe, if deſtitute of fibres, it would remain liquid. For it is out of the reach of credit, that <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> opinion ſhould hold true, that Harts, Does and Camels want them, but we muſt apprehend that they have but few, which are ſufficient to cauſe an indifferent concretion. But theſe fibres are of colour wholly white, repreſenting a nervous ſubſtance, from whence we may fetch an opinion, that they derive themſelves not from the Liver, but from the ventricle which is wholly nervous, and doth in ſome manner impart the nature of its ſubſtance to the Chyle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Blood is two-fold; the one lodged in the Veins, the other in the Arteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The venal is more craſſe, cold, and ruddy; and deſigned for the nouriſhment of parts of a ſolid ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arterial is thinner, hotter and inclining to yellow, and officious in the nutrition of parts of a ſpiritous ſubſtance.</hi>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:153522:23"/>
                  <p>The blood in the veins is derived immediately from the Liver, which it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies by a tincture of the nature and temper thereof; and ſo is colder then the arterial, whoſe forge is the heart, where it is elaborated to tenuity, and acquires a yellowiſh colour, by reaſon of aire confuſed with it in the left ventricle of the heart, which waſhes away that rich dye; therefore it is ſo much hotter then the heart, according to the proportion of that heat, which cauſeth an exceſſe in the temper of the heart, in relation to that of the Liver.</p>

                     <head>A COROLLARY.</head>
                     <p>Some have impudence enough to deny, that there is ſuch a thing as blood properly ſo called, but will needs argue the whole maſſe of humors to be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted only of choler, flegme and melancholy, and that the mixtion of theſe three humors is termed blood; of which aſſertion they indeavour to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration by the example of milke, which is immediately produced from blood, for in it there are only three homogeneous ſubſtances to be found, <hi>viz.</hi> butyrous, ſerous and caſeous, which are correſpondent to theſe three humors. But this opinion is weaken'd by this, that nothing but true blood can paint in red the maſſe of humors: For choler is yellow, flegme white, and melancholy black. Beſides the carnous parts which in our body are many, bearing Analogy in colour and temper to blood, do peculiarly inſtance that this is the humor which they prey upon. But to the example of milke <hi>I reply;</hi> that it is not neceſſary that all things ſhould have the ſame parts as thoſe to whom they owe their generation: for the ſeed generated by the blood hath only two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirit and incraſſation. To this may be added, that that example argues rather againſt the choler than the blood, for butter is Analogous to blood, as hot and moiſt, as cheeſe to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but the ſerum admits of no ſuch compariſon to flegme, but rather to ichors, which are evacuated by Urine and ſweat, and obtain the very name of ſerum.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially notice is to be taken of that axiome, upon which we ground, that the reſolution of things is into the ſame maſſe from which they took their compoſition, by this is underſtood only their ultimate reſolution into the Elements. For things by a kind of gratitude ſurrender themſelves into the boſome of their firſt cauſes: But the Elements are the firſt bodies ingredient to the compoſition of all mixt bodies, which fall back again into them, but owe no ſuch duty to their ſecond cauſes; <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſh and bones after the deceaſe of the creature are reſolved into the Elements, but not into bread and other aliment, which ſupplies nutrition to them, or into ſeed and blood, out of which they were framed in conception.</p>

                  <p>THE more cold and moiſt part of the maſſe of blood, is called flegme, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated out of the cruder part of the Chyle, hence <hi>Galen</hi> terms it, crude and parboil'd blood, who aſſerts alſo that in a famine of blood, this being brought to maturation by a farther coction converts to blood, and that in the very veins by a <hi>Sanguifying</hi> vertue ſent to them as Auxiliary from the Liver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cold and moiſt aliments produce a great fertility of it, ſo Age, winter, and a cold and moiſt temper of the Liver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the winter ariſeth cauſe of doubt, for that our bellies according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> are hotter in winter by reaſon they are the randezvouz of the native heat, which in this ſeaſon concentring there muſt neceſſarily be commodious for concoction, and ſo there will be no plenty of crude humors generated. <hi>To this I oppoſe;</hi> that flegme is abundantly generated in winter, not in reſpect of the efficient cauſe, but of the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> aliments, which in this ſeaſon are cold, compact, and not eaſily concocted. Now alſo the appetite is very vigorous, and makes roome for a large quantity of aliment, which by reaſon it is ſo copious cannot be well dreſſ'd, but remains a crude Chyle, which converts into crude blood; for the errour of the firſt is not amended by the ſecond coction, as <hi>Galen</hi> affirms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is uſefull for the Nutrition of the Cold and Moiſt parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The brain and the <hi>Spinalis medulla</hi> bear an Analogy to flegme, therefore they are nouriſhed by it, as appears by the cuſtomary excretions of the brain. This alimentary flegme is commonly termed pituitous blood, as choler and melancholy bilious and melancholick blood; into which we muſt make a curious inquiry, leſt we in peruſing Authors, ſhould be lead into an error, when we find them aſſert, that all the parts acknowledge their nutrition from the blood.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Alimentary Choler is the thinner part of the blood, Hot and Dry, ſomething bitter and yellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS the four humors correſpond to the four Elements, ſo Choler to a fiery nature, generated from the more hot and dry part of the Chyle; having a touch of amaritude, though not ſo copious as excrementitious choler, for then it would be unfit ſo nutrition. For it is undoubtedly true, that bitter things afford no nouriſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which excell in amaritude, for hyſope, ſuccory, and many other things, which have but a ſleight tincture of it, are nutritive. So alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary choler, having but a ſmal ſtock of it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo that the parts nauſeate it not.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:153522:24"/>It is alſo potentially not actually dry, becauſe all humors are fluid, and actually moiſt; yet potentially it cauſeth dryneſs, as ſea water, or brine may be termed dry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hot and Dry aliments, fat and oily, Manly age, Summer ſeaſon, a Liver of a hot and dry temper cauſeth it to abound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems averſe from Reaſon, that fat and oily aliments, being hot and moiſt, and ſo more accommodate to the production of blood, ſhould be converted into Choler.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this may be anſwered,</hi> That in their proper temper they are more fit for the generation of blood; but being of a ſubſtance eaſily inflammable, and meeting with bodies prepared and diſpoſed to the production of bilious ſiccity, they are eaſily naturalized into Choler: Hence it is cuſtomary with Phyſicians to aſſert, that ſweet things do with little difficulty change into Choler; which is alwaies to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of bodies hot and bilious; for in bodies more cold and temperate is rather produced blood, as is evident in Honey and Milk; for Honey for Old men, and Milk for Children is very nutritive, but both in men of full age, or hotter conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, are reduced into Choler.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The duty of which is to nouriſh the ſimilary parts, and to be in place of ſalt to the blood, which as ſawce being pleaſant to the parts, cauſeth in them a greedier appetite to imbibe the blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the parts which receive nutrition from the bilious blood, the Lungs are eſteemed the principal, whoſe ſubſtance being ſo rare that they can eaſily entertain the Air, want not much nutriment from the blood.</p>
                  <p>But the ſweetneſs of the other humors being tempered by a ſleight mixture of bilious amaritude, gives a pleaſing taſte to the whole maſs, which makes the parts prey with more delight upon the aliment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The effect of it is to make men in whom there is plenty of it, ready, watchful, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to anger, and lean.</hi>

                  <p>THE thicker part of the Chyle alters into Melancholy, which is as it were the mud and dregs of the blood, like the lees of wine, which uſually repair to the bottome of the tub; it is therefore ſet in ſimilitude with Earth.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>It affords nouriſhment to the parts of a like temper.</hi>

                  <p>Of this nature the Milt is the chief, then the bones, which though not reſembling it in colour, are yet of a relative temper, but acquire whitereſs by a further coction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The effect of it is, where it is predominant, to produce fear, ſadneſs, rudneſs in carriage, and a black colour.</hi>

                  <p>Obſcure and dark ſpirits run through the bodies of melancholy men, which repreſent ſad apparitions to their mind, and introduce dulneſs.</p>

This then is that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick humor which cauſes ingenuity, invention of Arts and Sciences and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent skill in tillage, but not that naturall melancholy, which operates ſtolidity and ſtupidity, from whence it is denominated <hi>Aſinine Melancholy.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>THE Primary humors lodged in the veins and honoured with the title of blood, are wafted to every part, that they may be nutritive to them all: but when they begin to be changed by the parts, they entertaine the name of Secundary Humors. Some rather terme them humidities then humors, becauſe part of them fall into the nature of the Subſtance of the parts rather then of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: ſo that they ſtand in oppoſition to the four ſiccities of the parts propoſed by <hi>Galen,</hi> which is not voide of reaſon. But yet they will admit the name of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, by reaſon that they are the immediate conſequences of the primary humors, nor are yet true parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they are four; the firſt is called Unnamed or inbred Humor, the ſecond Dew, the third Glue, the fourth Cambium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe four ſecundary are anthenticated by <hi>Avicen. Fen.</hi> 1. <hi>firſt Can. Doct.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. which he ſpins out of <hi>Galen,</hi> who <hi>in book</hi> 7. <hi>Meth.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Unnamed or inbred humor is that, which borders upon the ſmal veines, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be ſlightly changed by the particular members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the blood is conveyed out of the larger veſſels into the more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which nature hath placed in every part, the qualities of that part flow into it, and by this change beginning to inveſt it ſelf in the nature of the part, it becomes the firſt of the four Secundary humors, which wanting an impoſed name is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>unnamed,</hi> but ſome moderns have termed it <hi>inbred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is then called Dew, when like Dew it waters the ſubſtance of the parts, and is entertained in the ſmal pores, it is generated out of the Unnamed humor, but not without much alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, till it is aſſimilated to the nature of the part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is then called Glue, when this rorid humor cloſes with the parts to an agglutination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, it is termed Cambium, when this Glue alters into, and ſtands in Analogy with the ſubſtance of the parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſcrimination of theſe two laſt humidities is underſtood, from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence diſtinguiſhing between union and aſſimilation. This appears by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hitherto of alimentary humors. Excrementitious are thoſe, which are not diſpoſed for nutrition, but are baniſhed and ſeparated from the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They are four; Choler Melancholy, Serum and Flegme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Excrementitious Choler, is an excrement attenuated in the ſecond coction, hot and dry, of colour yellow, of taſte bitter, the purgation of which is at the bladder of the Gall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ALL coctions have their excrements, becauſe all parts of the aliment cannot be fitly deſigned to nutrition, therefore the uſeful part is ſeparated from the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and turned out of doores, ſo the excrements of the firſt coction are the dregs which are conveyed thorough the belly. But the excrements of the ſecond Coction are 3, which being referred to the humors, are in this place to be explained.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt excrement of the ſecond coction, is a thin humor hot and dry, and very bitter, therefore of no aptitude for nutrition, it is conveyed to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the gall partly by the expulſive faculty of the Liver, partly by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of that bladder, which nature hath framed to a familiarity and ſympathy with that humor, that it might deſire and delight in its company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is uſeful to ſummon the expulſive faculty of the inteſtines to her duty, and to ſcoure the ſticking flegme which is apt to adhere to the tunicles ofthe inteſtines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the felleous bladder hath attracted the choler, and for ſome ſpace enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its welcome gueſt, till being ſharpned by this delay, it moves this veſſel to an expulſion, and is ſent to the <hi>duodenum</hi> by a veſſel deſigned for this office, which is called <hi>porus cholidochus.</hi> Now this choler being brought down to the inteſtines, by its acrimony, ſtirrs and moves their expulſive faculty, by which our purgaments are with more eaſe excluded, which many times by the intermixtion of choler, repreſent a yellow or reddiſh tincture. And alſo the inteſtines uſually abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much viſcid and ſticking flegme, receive this benefit from the choler, that it cuts and purges it away, and ſo helps its excluſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is differenced two wayes, either as it confines it ſelf to its natural conſtitution, or as it dilates it ſelf beyond the proportion and allowance of nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When it is content with its natural limits it is two-fold, Yellow and Pale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yellow is that which is contained in the bladder, clean and unmixt, which was now mentioned. Pale is when a Serous humor is mixed with the Yellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serum</hi> mingled with choler, waſhes away its yellowneſs, and induceth paleneſſe, cold and moiſture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When it is in exceſſe beyond the bounds of nature, the</hi> ſpecies <hi>of it are four,</hi> Vitelline, Porraceous, Eruginous <hi>and</hi> Glaſteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Vitelline <hi>in colour and conſiſtency is like the yolk of raw eggs, hot to a higher degree than the yellow, and is produced from it by the alteration and incraſſation of vehement heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When by the acrimony of preternatural heat the natural choler is ſcorch'd, its thinner parts are diſperſed; by which means it is incraſſated, and acquires a deeper grain, and more intenſe heat. For we muſt ſhut our eares againſt <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who aſſerts that the tranſmutation of yellow choler into Vitelline is cauſed by the admixtion of flegme; for by this reaſon it would become more pallid and cold.</p>
                  <p>Porraceous <hi>Choler, repreſenting the colour of a Leeke, is hotter then the Vitelline, and is commonly bred in the ventricle, being produced by impure aliments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:153522:25"/>
                  <p>This is green like a leeke, which tincture it receives from bad aliments, ſuch as garlicke, onions, leekes, watercreſſes, colewortes, and the like; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſability in the ventricle to concoct them, and naturalize them to Chyle, are parch'd, yet generally retaining their own hue, from whence this is termed porraceous choler. Here it is obſervable, that this happens not but in very hot ſtomachs; It is alſo ſometimes generated in other parts of our body, out of the vitelline choler over-heated, whence it cloths it ſelf in green.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eruginous choler, being of the colour of ruſt, is produced by a more parching heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the porraceous choler delayes its remove out of the ventricle, being aduſt by preternatural and intenſe heat, it alters into eruginous choler. The ſeat ſometimes of its generation is the veins, by heat very intenſe, which ſcorches the aforementioned <hi>ſpecies</hi> of choler, and is very ſharp and malignant; hence erugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous dejections are counted by <hi>Hippocraies</hi> deadly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glaſteous choler, aſſimilated in colour to wood, is produced from the reſt by a greater inflammation, and is more dangerous then all of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is nearly allied to black choler, being of a colour more obſcure and dul then the reſt, which is cauſed by a greater torrefaction, therefore it is more dangerous and pernicious then the other.</p>

                  <p>THat part of the Chyle which is more craſſe and feculent, ſo that it is beyond the art of the Liver to change it into alimentary ſubſtance, is ſecluded from the maſſe of blood, that that may not be infected with the leaſt adheſion of impurity; which craſſe and earthy matter is termed excrementitious melancholy, and that the expurgation thereof may be the more commodious, the good Artiſt nature contrived a peculiar part for it, nearly related in likeneſs to this humor, which therefore it attracts to it ſelf, and impriſons in its ſoft and looſe ſubſtance; but in the interim, being ſolicitous for its own nouriſhment, it ſeparates the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick blood confuſed with it, for that purpoſe and aſſimilates it to it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:153522:26"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is helpfull to the coction of the Stomack, and excites in it a natural appetency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this humor hath been long harboured in the milt, and growes burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to it, its baniſhed to the ventricle, by a paſſage whoſe extent is to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, which is termed the ſhort veſſel. It is not wholly uſeles, but helps the coction and retention of the ventricle, <hi>as Galen,</hi> 5. <hi>of the uſe of parts.</hi> For it contracts the ventricle, and collects the aliment into a narrower circumference, cauſing retention till it be concocted, for this humor is ſomething aſtrictive. <hi>Avicenna</hi> is of opinion that it moves a natural appetency by that acidity which it carries along with it, as all acide things do the like; hence a cuſtome is derived to preſent firſt at the Table vinegar-cates to rouze the appetite. This is the reaſon that melancholick men have craving ſtomacks, becauſe of the plentifull effuſion of this humor into the ventricle.</p>
                  <p>We may conjecture <hi>Galen</hi> to have been of this opinion, who in his <hi>firſt booke of the cauſes of Symptomes,</hi> aſſerts this doglike appetite to proceed from the plenty of acide juices generated in the ventricle, or flowing into the orifice of it from ſome other place. If therefore melancholick juyce which is acide, being too plentifull and overflowing the bancks of nature, cauſeth hunger preternatural, it is without exception true, that that moderate one which is content with the limitation of nature, ſhould move natural hunger.</p>
                  <p>Here ſome may take occaſion <hi>to object,</hi> That flegme being acide excites a canine appetite, no leſſe than melancholy, therefore natural hunger may be the effect of it, when it exceeds not a moderate proportion. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> The conſequence is weak, becauſe acide flegm is alwayes preternatural, and the effect of a diſeaſe; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is natural, being by the operation of nature daily unloaded in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, therefore it is efficacious in natural productions; ſo is not acide flegme, nor an over-repleat or morbous melancholy, which being preternatural, can only produce preternatural hunger. Beſides this the melancholick humor affords other aſſiſtance to the coction and appetency of food, <hi>viz.</hi> as it helps their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as we perceive all acide things do, as vineger, the diſſolution of Stones by the juyce of limmons, and rebellious metals by the ſpirits of Vitriol, Nitre, and Sulphur. I have treated more at large of theſe <hi>in my Medicinal praxis, Chapter of offended concoction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when excrementitious melancholy is preternatural, it admits the term of black choler, which is very hot, and acrimonious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Black choler is the moſt pernicious of all humors, which is alwayes preternatural, enemy to all the parts of the body, and plotting our deſtruction, corroding, exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and ſcorching the parts to which it adheres, by reaſon of its extraordinary acrimony: If it be powred upon the earth, like the moſt ſharp vineger, or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> it ferments it, and by boiling inflateth bubbles. It is generated from the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat of the parts, which inflames to aſhes the juyce contained in them, or from a putredinous heat in the humors, the force of which cauſing a conſumption in the more thin and humid parts, the more groſſe remain as aduſt and incinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dreggs. But this incineration cannot be ſo unnatural in the humors, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of a fluid conſiſtency and the proper form of humors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this black Choler is differenced four wayes, extracted from the differences of its cauſes,</hi> viz. <hi>as it is generated out of Melancholy, Choler, Blood, or ſalt Flegme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſpecies of black Choler is produced from the putrefaction and aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153522:26"/>on of natural melancholy, and is different from it, as dregs burnt from unburnt, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands from coales, red hot Iron from cold. The <hi>Second</hi> proceeds from yellow choler much ſcorched, for as from a leſſe combuſtion the Vitelline, Porraceous, Erugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and Glaſteous; ſo from a more fervent is this production of black choler, threatning more danger then al the reſt, which is really that which excommunicates flies, and ferrnentates the Earth. The <hi>Third</hi> iſſues from an extreme putrefaction or exuſtion of blood; for then the more ſubtile parts of it are converted into yellow choler, the more groſſe into black, if the aduſtion be vehement; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it abhorrs the nature of this noiſome humor, and only alters into a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cold and dry. But when by an intenſe heat it is heightned to ignition retaining very <hi>Empyreuma</hi> of heat, it is changed into the true nature of black choler, yet it is more candid then the reſt, as often remembring its former nature. But that there is black choler may be demonſtrated in carbunculous tumors, which are cauſed by thick and hot blood, and often become true Cancers. The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt proceeds from ſalt Flegme, which by a long continued ſcorching becomes ſo biting and infeſtious that it ſeems to be very near allied to black choler; though it be very ſeldome reckoned with the ſpecies of black choler, and many do obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately contend that there is no ſuch thing: For flegme being white, cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour it ſelf into black, unles it be by the mediation of other colours, as yellow, green, and the reſt: Beſides, if the flegme be exuſt, the more thin parts of it will ſuffer a reſolution, but the thicker converted into a Limy ſubſtance, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally retains its whiteneſſe. And it is thought that ſalt flegme, having been incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a vehement combuſtion, obtains ſuch a degree of malignancy and force of eroſion, that as to its qualities, it is nothing different from black choler; but as to the whiteneſſe of it, it is not abſurd to affirm, that it may ſometimes convert into black, in a violent and unequal uſtion, by the permiſtion of ſmoak and ſteams: as we ſee the whiteſt wood, to be immediately changed into coales, but when it is eaſily concocted and by degrees, as when it becomes a Limy ſubſtance, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its colour.</p>

But when the Liver hath diſcharged its duty in ſanguifying, there is not further neceſſity for ſo much moiſture, therefore nature ſegregates the greater part of it, which it hath deſigned to be attracted by the Reins, and from thence is excluded to the bladder, where it is called Urine, but before while it confines it ſelf to the veines it is called Serum. Part of which remaining ſtill in the veines, is confuſed with the maſſe of blood, to be the vehicle of the humors, which being made more thin and fluid, may have an eaſier acceſſe to every particle of our body; but when this portion of Serum hath performed its office, part of it retires to the Reins, and accompanies the other Urine, part inclines to the bulk of the body, and is purged by ſweat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The office of it is, to be a conduct to the alible humors, for their eaſier tranſmigration thorough the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called to this duty as long as it is lodged in the veins: but when it hath broke up houſe there, it is uſeleſs in the body, as choler, and melancholy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The differences of it are four,</hi> viz. <hi>ſanguinious, bilious, pituitous, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every humor hath its Serum properly and peculiarly appertaining to it, and aſſimilated to its proper nature and temper; ſo the Serum of the blood, is held to be hot, moiſt and ſomewhat red; the Serum of choler hot, dry, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what yellow; the Serum of flegme cold, moiſt, and ſomewhat white; and the Serum of melancholy cold, dry, and of colour dark.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Excrementitious Flegme.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">Excrementitious flegme is an excrement of the third concoction, Cold and Moiſt, of colour white, as to the taſte inſipid, or ſomething ſweat, generated in divers parts, but principally in the brain.</head>
                  <p>PArts of a cold and moiſt temper, derive their nutrition from pituitous blood, from whence proceed many excrements, cauſed either by the coldneſs of the part it ſelf unapt to concoct perfectly, or by the humor it ſelf, which being the more crude part of the blood, is of a difficult concoction, and a great part of it converts into excrements. Which is very evident in the brain, for that copiouſly gathers excrementitious flegme, which is purged out of the mouth and noſe. But the brain collects not this flegme, ſolely by the concoction of its proper aliment, but by reaſon of its advanced ſituation, which is the cauſe that many vapors from the ventricle, Liver and other bowels make upward to the head, and by the frigidity of the brain are condenſed into a wateriſh matter, which is the original of this flegme. Hence by reaſon of the copiouſneſs of flegme congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the brain theſe two wayes, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and other Phyſicians have termed the braine, <hi>The Metropolis of Flegme, and Author of all defluxions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:153522:27"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is differenced by the taſte and conſiſtency of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In relation to the taſt it is four-fold, Inſipid, Sweet, Acide and ſalt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inſipid proceedes from moderate cold, which cauſeth no taſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the moſt natural, being an excretion in well diſpoſed bodies conveyed away by the ſpittle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sweet is produced from the inſipid by a ſmal alteration of heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the inſipid is concocted by a moderate heat, it is ſweetned, for ſweetneſs is the produce of heat: but yet hence we muſt not inferre that ſweet flegme is hot; becauſe indeed an intenſe ſweetneſs ſignifies heat, but not a ſleight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate one; ſo fruit and milk of a cold temper, yet are much ſweeter then any flegme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Acide is cauſed by intenſe cold inducing Acidity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the ſmal heat of the flegme is extinguiſhed, or diſſipated, the neceſſary conſequence is acidity: no otherwiſe then as the juyces of many fruites meanly hot, being infrigidated, become eaſily acide; which fares not ſo with hotter, which do uſually retain their ſoundneſſe longer; as appears by wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salt Flegme is produced either by putrefaction, or the permixtion of ſalt ſerous moiſture. As</hi> Galen <hi>in</hi> Book 2. of the diff. feb. cap. 5.</p>
                  <p>It becomes ſalt by putrefaction, becauſe when putrefaction makes a ſeparation between the ſiccity, and humidity, and that ſiccity being parched by a putredinous heat, falleth again into conjunction with the humid ſubſtance, it cauſeth a ſalt taſte. But it proceeds from the permixtion of ſalt ſerous humidity, which being too much brin'd by intenſe heat, is mingled with the ſweet flegme; but the ſerous humidity becomes ſalt, when the action of heat upon it produceth ſcorched vapours, which by permiſtion with it cauſe ſaltneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that theſe two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of flegme, <hi>viz.</hi> the acide and ſalt are preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but the ſweet and inſipid natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to its conſiſtency, it is alſo four-fold, Thin, Thick, Vitreous and Gypſeous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Thin is of a watery conſiſtency, very fluid and eaſily diffuſing it ſelf into divers parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is that which diſtilles from the brain thorough the noſe, and flowes thorough the mouth, and is effuſed alſo in many parts, thorough the middle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of the muſcles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thick is when this thin hath acquired incraſſation and clammineſſe by heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heat by reſolution incraſſates the thinner parts, whence this flegme being gluiſh, is properly called <hi>Snot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vitreous flegme is ſtill thick, but tranſparent as liquefied glaſſe, or the white of a raw Egge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſturdy doubt, and reſolved to my knowledg, by no Auther, why <hi>vitreous flegme,</hi> and that which is termed <hi>craſſe,</hi> are for the moſt part equally craſſe, yet one is very tranſparent and diaphanous, the other very obſcure. This in my opinion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the diverſity of the efficient cauſe, which of craſſe flegme is heat, but of the vitreous, cold: In the craſſe the heat reſolves the thinner, more airy and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh parts, which cauſe perſpicuity, hence it is clouded with opacity; but in the vitreous, being incraſſated by cold, not by heat, while it is ſo condenſed nothing is reſolved, but the diaphanous parts remain, from whence it ſeems tranſparent; as is manifeſt in ice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it will be objected;</hi> That flegme cannot acquire ſuch a degree of cold in our body, that by the force of it, it may be condenſed and incraſſated, all our body being actually hot; therefore whatſoever is cold, is neceſſarily heated by the part in which it is contained. <hi>To this I Anſwer,</hi> That that flegme, to which the vitreous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153522:28"/>owes its production, is exceedingly crude, and out-vying the ſtrength of nature, therefore it is baniſh'd her dominious as contumacions and inſuperable, and remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to its proper nature, <hi>viz.</hi> coldneſs, communicated to it by water, and invincible by the weak heat of the parts in which it is contained, as the inteſtines, which are the head quarters of this vitreous flegme, and doth not ſeldome torture them with moſt painfull fits of the Collick, for by its glewy nature adhering to the inteſtineſs, by its cold it bites and nips them, for coldneſs is biting, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hipp.</hi> it is cold to ſuch extremity, that the expurgation of it is actually cold, by the teſtimony of <hi>Galen</hi> by a near experiment in himſelf, as in his 4. <hi>book of affected parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gypſeous flegme is the production of craſſe flegme, emulating Limc or a ſtone almoſt in hardneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rejects the name of humor, being conſolidated; therefore improperly placed in the claſſe of humors. It proceeds from heat pillaging all the humid parts, ſo that there is nothing left but earthy parts, which are indurated into a Tophace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter, almoſt reſembling lime, this often perplexeth the joints cauſing the knotty Gout.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Thus much of the Humors: the Treatiſe of Spirits ſucceeds, which are generated out of them, but chiefly out of Blood.</head>
                  <p>THE Spirits of our bodies being of ſubſtance ſo thin, that they are impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to the quickeſt glance of ſenſe; and by this means reaſon only can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us in the truth of their exiſtence: it will not be amiſſe therefore to inform, that our bodies have ſuch attendents, before their nature and eſſence be propoſed,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore the context in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 6. <hi>Epid. ſect.</hi> 8. is very convincing, where he reckons three things which conſtitute the compoſition of our body, <hi>viz.</hi> things <hi>containing, contained, and cauſing motion;</hi> by the containing, he ſignifies the parts, by the contained the humors, by thoſe that cauſe motion the ſpirits, according to the explanation of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, for ſuch is the tenuity and nobility of the ſpirits, that with wonderfull ſwiftneſſe they can ſhoot themſelves to any place, and inſinuate themſelves into all the parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Platonicks</hi> do thus demonſtrate the neceſſity of ſpirits; nature doth not uſually joine two contraries or things of wide diſtance without the help of a <hi>medium,</hi> but the ſoul and body differ in the whole latitude of their <hi>genus,</hi> for the ſoul is incorporeal, and immortal, but the body corporeal, frail and mortal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a diſſiliency in natures cannot be forced to unition but by ſome <hi>medium</hi> and common obligation, leaning as it were to both natures; ſuch are the ſpirits, which indeed are material, but in tenuity ambitious of the nature of things immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:153522:28"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This appears by prolifical ſeed, which is wholly ſpumous, and inflated with ſpirits, which diſappearing leave nothing but a wateriſh and unfruitful liquor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are nouriſhed by the ſame things of which we are conflated, but attraction of breath or aire is neceſſary to our conſervation; therefore we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in us ſome ſuch ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This is evident by thoſe great and empty cavities, which are found in the ventricles of the brain, and arteries of men deceaſed, which are obſerved in the living ſwelled to a palpitation, which clearly convinceth, that thoſe vacuities could not be repleat with any other thing then ſuch ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But a Spirit is a ſubſtance thin, clear and etherial, proceeding from the exhalation of pure blood, and the inſpiration of aire, neceſſary for the due performance of all duties the body is engaged to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called <hi>a thin ſubſtance,</hi> becauſe with incredible ſubtility and clerity it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates and courſes thorough the whole bulk of the body, and ſteals into the narroweſt pores of the leaſt particles and intervals of the muſcles: it is called clear, and bright, not according to the vulgar opinion (as <hi>Argenterius</hi> fanſies) but becauſe it excels in ſplendor and perſpicuity, which is eaſily ſeen in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the eye, the ball of which is very clear, and we may ſpin an argument for the probation of it out of this, that when ſome vapours of the melancholick humor, or of over-ſwelling in drunken men, are predominant, the mind is in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perturbation, by reaſon of the dulneſs of theſe fogs which ſuffocate the ſpirits. And of this <hi>Avicenna</hi>'s demonſtration is beyond all exception, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>our ſoul</hi> (which tranſacts every thing by her ſervants the ſpirits) <hi>loves light and no darkneſs, and the ſpirits do their duty with much more alacrity, in a ſerene then in a cloudy day;</hi> hence it is plain, that they are excited by ſimilitude. They are alſo called <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial,</hi> becauſe the matter of them is by long elaboration ſo defecated, that it ſtands in competition with that higher Element, which is next neighbour to the celeſtial bodies, and is called the Element of fire, or etherial.</p>
                  <p>But that the ſpirits ſtart out of the permixtion of blood and aire, ſhall appear in the explication of their differences.</p>
                  <p>The uſes of them are declared in the end, for the ſoul cannot in the leaſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the body without the officiouſneſs of the ſpirits, becauſe they have the honour to be immediately and principally ſubſervient to her.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Differences of Spirits.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">Spirits are two-fold; Inbred and Adventitious. Inbred is the relict of the firſt principles in every part.</head>
                  <p>IT is called <hi>inbred, innate,</hi> or <hi>implanted,</hi> according to the Greek <hi>Connate,</hi> but while our parts are compoſed out of the firſt principles of our generation, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeed and blood, that ſpiritous ſubſtance which is contained in the ſeed conſtitutes the inbred ſpirit. But this reaſon convinceth that this ſpirit is communicated to every part, becauſe the adventitious cannot be brought forth without the midwifery
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153522:29"/>of this, every production being like to its Author. And alſo the prolifical ſeed iſſuing from every part argues that a ſpiritous matter is derived from every part, from the ſound parts ſound, from morbous parts morbous, which in the iſſue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adventitious is that which flowes, and is ſent in from ſome other place for the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſervation of the Inbred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inbred ſpirit continually laborious in the performance of the functions of the parts would eaſily be conſumed, unleſſe it were preſerved and refreſhed by the continual influence of this ſtranger; therefore nature hath contrived ſome parts, which ſhould be the forge of great plenty of ſpirits, which by their allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courſes, influx into all the parts of the body, to defend the inbred ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſpirit is three-fold;</hi> Natural, Vital <hi>and</hi> Animal; <hi>The Natural is produced in the Liver, out of the thinner part of Blood tempered with a little Aire, whoſe influence is thorough the veins into the whole body, for the due exerciſe of the natural faculties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Natural ſpirit hath cauſed much diſſention among Authors becauſe ſome upon the ground of pregnant reaſons, deny nature the aſſiſtance of any ſuch ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> was not reſolved of it, <hi>book</hi> 12. <hi>method. cap.</hi> 5. where he thus diſcourſeth, <hi>If any ſpirit be natural, it is contained in the Liver as its fountain, and in the veins as its inſtruments:</hi> And <hi>his firſt book of parts affected, laſt chap.</hi> the natural faculties are by him differenced from the animal by this diſtinction, that the natural are implanted in the parts, but the animal are ſent in from ſome other principle, as light from the Sun: whence it happens that animal actions do not ſeldome periſh in the parts, though they receive no hurt, but only the principle of them, but the natural are never hurt, while the parts are free from harme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Aire is the matter of all ſpirits, for out of it and clear exhalations from the blood, they are produced. But there is no paſſage thorough which the air may be conveyed to the Liver. Therefore that can be no ſeat for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſpirits are according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the cauſers of motion, therefore if the veins harbour ſpirits they ſhould beat no leſſe then the Arteries.</p>
                  <p>But the principal argument to confirme the aſſertion of natural ſpirits is this; Three actions ſpecifically diſtinct are exerciſed in our bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal, Vital, and Natural; but the exerciſe of action is the duty of the ſpirits, as <hi>Galen</hi> very often affirms; therefore we muſt neceſſarily conſtitute three ſpirits differing in <hi>ſpecies, viz.</hi> the Animal, Vital and Natural. If you <hi>object,</hi> that natural actions are exerciſed by the inbred ſpirits. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> that the adventitious are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for conſervation of the inbred, which bear a ſimilitude of nature to them, the production of which is acknowledged from the Liver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Oppoſe</hi> therefore to the <hi>firſt</hi> argument, eſtabliſhed by the authority of <hi>Galen</hi> in oppoſition to this; that the rudeneſs, obſcurity, and non-purity of this ſpirit created ſometimes in <hi>Galen</hi> a doubt, it being more caliginous and terreſtrial, then the Vital, and proportioned to thoſe actions which it is deſigned to performe. But though the faculties be implanted in the parts, they want the help of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious ſpirits for exerciſe, and to hinder the diſſipation of the implanted ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>the ſecond I Anſwer,</hi> That the natural ſpirits want but little aire, which by inſenſible tranſpiration, by the Arteries knitted to the veins of the Liver, and by the continual ventilation of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> are eaſily imparted to the Liver.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>the third I Anſwer,</hi> That the beating of the Arteries is not cauſed by the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153522:29"/>ſpirits, but by a pulſifick vertue communicated to them from the heart. But the Liver being not endowed with ſuch a faculty, the veins which have a dependence upon it, do not beat, for it is not neceſſary, becauſe the blood and natural ſpirits want no ſuch ventilation, but are well enough preſerved only by tranſpiration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Vital is generated in the heart, by the natural ſpirit, and the attraction of the air by inſpiration, and by the help of the Arteries flowes into the whole body, for the preſervation of natural heat, and defence of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſtands better with reaſon, that the vital ſpirits, which ſurpaſſe in tenuity, ſhould be generated out of that ſpiritous ſubſtance prepared and attenuated in the Liver, rather then out of the venal blood only, which is deſtitute of ſpirits, for as the animal owes its production to the vital, ſo it may be ſuppoſed the vital is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the natural. Therefore that natural ſpirit being conveyed to the left ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the heart with the purer part of the blood is intermixed with aire, arriving thither by the inſpiration of the Lungs thorough the venal artery, whence by the inbred force of the heart and innate heat by joynt elaboration the vitall ſpirits are generated, which being after tranſported to the Arteries, are conducted thorough the whole body, that they may nouriſh and preſerve the whole body by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous heat.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>A portion of the vital ſpirit is conducted to the brain by the Arterie <hi>Carotides,</hi> whoſe courſe is thorough the neck: and in the ventricles of the brain is mingled with air, attracted thorough the high-way of the mouth and noſtrils, where by the idioſincracy of the brain it is changed, and acquires a new form, and becomes Animal ſpirit fit for the performance of animal actions, for during its continuance in the veins, it is the principal officer and chief inſtrument in the execution of theſe actions, but while it flowes thorough the nerves into the various parts of the body, it compleates and perfects the motion of the ſenſes.</p>

                     <p>THE reaſons following will ſufficiently evince, that there is no Animal ſpirit:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The cold and moiſt ſubſtance of the brain cannot be convenient for the generation of ſpirits, which are hot and thin; ſince there muſt neceſſarily be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſimilitude in all productions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> All vapors which aſcend to the brain, by the frigidity of it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed to a concretion, and turned into water; Therefore if the ſpirits, which are of a like nature, were contained in the brain, they would in like manner be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidated to a concretion.</p>

                        <hi>Fiftly,</hi> If theſe ſpirits were houſed in the brain, ſenſation and cogitation would alwayes be quick, becauſe the faculties of the ſoul give conſtant attendance, and are alwayes in action, till they want inſtruments.</p>

                     <p>To <hi>the ſecond I Anſwer,</hi> That the ſpirits are not concrete in the brain, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, becauſe they are not the chief conſtitutions of a wateriſh nature, but rather of Aery, or Aethereal one.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the third,</hi> with <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> conſent, 2. <hi>of the ſoul chap.</hi> 8. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can imploy the ſame thing in the buſineſs of divers offices, as the tongue primarily for the taſte, ſecundarily for ſpeech: the noſtrils primarily for ſmel, and inſpiration of aire, but ſecundarily for the conveying away of mucous flegme: ſo the ventricles of the brain are primarily contrived for the generation of ſpirits; ſecundarily for the expurgation of excrements, but theſe excrements by reaſon of their continual purging and effluxion cannot be infectious to the Animal ſpirits, as long as the brain ſquares to Nature.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the fourth I oppoſe,</hi> That the ſpirits break not forth thorough thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels in which the excrements ſtream, being retained by the friendly nature of the part and familiarity of the ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the fifth I Anſwer,</hi> That the concurrence of three things cauſe cogitation, Faculty, Inſtrument, and Object; all which being ſupplyed, the mind operates inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably: for not only waking, but often alſo ſleeping we exerciſe our cogitations, becauſe we uſe the object of the internal ſenſes, but both failing, cogitation ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: as alſo in default of the Inſtrument, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal ſpirit, which is tyred with many operations; whence the careful ingeniety of nature, hath provided ſleep for living creatures, by the benefit of which, as it were by a truce, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal actions keep high Holy-day, and the ſpirits are refreſhed.</p>

                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">Innate Heat is the primigenious moiſture, diffuſed thorough all the parts of the body, and every where replete with implanted ſpirit and native Heat.</head>
                  <p>HEat is a concrete term, which ſignifies not only an accident, but the ſubject to which it inheres. There are therefore three things concurring to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of innate heat; <hi>viz.</hi> primigenious moiſture, implanted ſpirit, and native heat; in the ſpirit is conſtant heat, but this implanted ſpirit is alwayes in conjunction with this primigenious moiſture and confuſed with it, and from them ſo united,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153522:30"/>reſults the innate heat. The true underſtanding therefore of theſe three will cauſe an eaſy knowledg of the nature of innate heat, and the implanted ſpirit was at large explained before, the primigenious moiſture and native heat only reſt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Primigenious moiſture is a humid, fat, and oily ſubſtance diffuſed thorough all the body, by preying on which as its proper food the native heat is preſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines life to be the dwelling of native heat in certain moiſture, that therefore this heat, the Author and preſerver of life, may long continue in the parts, it wants certain fuel, no leſſe than our fire, to keep it from extinction. But moiſture being two-fold in our body, one wateriſh, the other fat and aiery, this vivifying heat cannot be fuelled, by the wateriſh, but by the fat and aiery moiſture, as a lampe or candle lighted is not inflamed by wateriſh, but oily and pingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous liquor, or ſome ſuch like ſubſtance: ſo Trees and other Plants, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this fat ſubſtance, are of long continuance, and excellent fuel, when they are burned; But on the other ſide green wood, in which wateriſh humidity is as copious, or wood of too much growth, in which this fat humidity is exſiccated, make no good fire. But when we diſcourſe of oily and fat ſubſtance, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not that fat or greaſe which moſt commonly in women or idlers is collected about the skin and membranes, but hardly comes nigh the ſubſtance of the bones, nerves and bowels, for thoſe are not the ſubjects of vital heat, but are rather by their over-growth an impediment to actions. But this native and genital hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, according to its copiouſneſs is more uſeful and commodious to the exerciſe of all functions and the prolongation of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It derives its original from the firſt principles of our generation,</hi> viz. <hi>from the ſeed, and maternal blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt upſtart of our generation is abundantly furniſhed with this radical moiſture; hence it is, that when this is ſubſtantialized into the parts of our body, the whole maſſe in the preface of life is very well ſtock'd with this moiſture, which afterward by the continual action of the native heat is by degrees as our Age poſts away waſted and dryed, till it arrives to the laſt ſtage of exſiccation, whoſe conſequence is the extremity of Age, and natural death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the fat and oleous moiſture of Aliments is the cauſe of preſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While this moiſture continually ſuffers under the inſulting activity of heat, it would quickly fall into a conſumption, unleſſe the loſſe were recompenced by the acceſſe of new aliment: At the charge of this reparation are fit aliments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by divers coctions, in which we find two-fold moiſture, one fat and aiery near related to the nature of the primigenious moiſture, and makes up the loſſe of it, the other wateriſh, keeping in repair the common humidity of the parts, which breaks the force of heat, leſt it ſhould conſume this fat and aiery moiſture, as appears in Sugar, Honey, or Oyle, when they are boiling, that the water mixt with them encounters the forces of the external fire, and is vanquiſhed, when they remain in their integrity or with ſmal diminution. And though the loſs cauſed by heat is continually repaired by new aliment, yet that which is acquired in the place of what is loſt, is much worſe, and more impure, and deficient both in quantity and quality, otherwiſe it were poſſible for life to be ſtretch'd to infinity, but this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migenious moiſture by degrees decaying, and it being impoſſible to equalize this diminution with any aliment, it inferres an abſolute neceſſity of death.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:153522:31"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Native heat is a quality proper and familiar to all living creatures, by the help of which they live and act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is in our bodies twofold, one the conſequent of the firſt mixtion of the body and parts, which after the deſtruction of the creature removes not, as long as mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion keeps its dwelling, which is made out of the foure Elements guarded with the retinue of their qualities; the other proper onely to living creatures, termed Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical, becauſe by it, as long as it is our gueſt, we obtain the advantage of nutrition, growth, conſervation and life; whence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines Life, as is before mentioned, the conſervation of this heat in certain moiſture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is derived from the firſt principles, as is the primigenious moiſture.</hi> The firſt principles of generation, ſeed eſpecially, is well fraught with many ſpirits, and much heat; hence this heat in our firſt conception exactly commenſurates all the parts, and as long as it ſojourns with us, afterward increaſeth and preſerveth them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſervation proceeds from the primigenious moiſture, by the ambiency of air, and influence of heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The primigenious moiſture is the ſubject of native heat, and its ordinary fare, which it continually devours for its own ſafety, as a Lamp alwayes needs Oyl for its conſervation; and Fire, the continual addition of Fuel; of which, as plenty cauſeth the inflammation to riſe higher, and withdrawing it a diminution, ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat is increaſed or diminiſhed according to the proportion of the primige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious moiſture: But, as is before alledged, this moiſture never increaſing, but waſting from the very Prologue of our life, it happens, that the heat alſo is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diminiſhed to the Epilogue of our life. And as our Fires lack not fuel alone for their preſervation, but alſo the kind embraces of Air, by which they may be refreſhed to refocillation; for being confined to a narrow circumſcription, though they have ſufficient fuel, yet they are ſuffocated; which is evident in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Cupping-glaſſes: So our native heat wants the ambient air, for commodious eventilation. But this air by the benefit of the Lungs is conducted to the Heart, which is the principal furnace of heat, but to other parts by inſenſible tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by the defect of which the heat is immediately ſuffocated, as appears in Suſpenſion.</p>
                  <p>But this native heat being weak in moſt parts of our body, and ſo eaſily obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to extinction, Nature hath ſo provided, that by the continual influence of heat it may be nouriſhed and ſuſtained. Hence Phyſicians divide Heat into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> implanted, and adventitious. The adventitious flows in from the two fountains of heat, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart and Liver, in company of the ſpirits and blood.</p>
                  <div type="corollary">
                     <head>A COROLLARY.</head>
                     <p>LEarned <hi>Fernelius</hi> was ſo tranſported in admiration of the noble effects of this native heat, that he was of opinion that it was to be ſtruck out of the number of Elementary qualities, as being of a higher extract, and wholly divine and heavenly; which leſt he ſhould ſeem an indeliberate babler, he endevours to evince by the following reaſons;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> All action depends upon a predominant quality, but there are in Nature examples of many Plants, as Poppy, Hemlock, Mandrakes; and of Animals, as the Salamander, which is thought to be cold in the fourth degree, yet they live, and heat is the cauſe of life; it is therefore neceſſary to conſtitute another heat, differing from the Elementary, (which in them is very weak) by the help of which they live, and exerciſe their actions.</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:153522:31"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Elementary heat cauſed life, Brimſtone, Arſenick, and ſuch like things, which are intenſely hot, would chiefly live; but they live not, becauſe they are deſtitute of this celeſtial and vivifying heat; ſo cadaverous reliques retain Elementary heat, yet live not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If our heat were Elementary, it would admit of no contrary Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary heat, as that of a Feaver, which moſt of all diſſolves it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, Fernelius</hi> grounds this aſſertion upon the authority of <hi>Ariſtotle, Book</hi> 2. <hi>of the Gener. of Anim. Chap.</hi> 3. where he affirms, That native heat is not of an igneous, but ſome more divine nature, <hi>correſpondent in proportion to the Element of the Stars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though this opinion is grounded upon the invention of a moſt ingenious and excellent Artiſt, we cannot betray our reaſon to it by a quiet aſſent; for the ſpecies of the qualities of our bodies are not without the command of neceſſity to be multiplyed; our judgement therefore is, that native heat is wholly of an Elementary nature, as we ſhall prove by the following arguments:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Celeſtial bodies have not the firſt qualities, for then they would be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, for all corruption depends upon the qualities; ſo the Philoſophers prove the Heavens incorruptible, becauſe they have no qualities. So they argue the Sun to have no heat in it, but to produce it in theſe inferiour bodies energetically and virtually, <hi>viz.</hi> by motion, light, and influence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If native heat were celeſtial, it would abhor a contrary, according to the ſenſe of <hi>Fernelius</hi> himſelf. But Elementary cold hath a contrary, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of cold ſometimes cauſeth death, by the extinction of native heat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not celeſtial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it were celeſtial, it would want no fuel to prey on; and if it wanted, it could not be proportioned to it in our body, for Celeſtial cannot be nouriſhed by Elementary. To this <hi>is oppoſed,</hi> That this heat, though it be celeſtial, is by a familiarity with elementary heats, changed as it were into elementary, or at leaſt models it ſelf into an elementary faſhion; which ſeems not ſatisfactory, becauſe celeſtials receive the impreſs of no paſſion from elementaries, it is not poſſible their nature ſhould be ſo inverted, as to ſavour of the conditions of things ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Native heat derives its original from ſeed, and ſeed from blood and ſpirits, which are alſo the production of blood; but the blood is elementary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by conſequence native heat.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> though they repreſent ſome truth, yet may be eaſily thus reſolved by us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the firſt I anſwer,</hi> That heat in a living body is twofold; one as the body is mixt, the other as it is living; as mixt, it hath the foure firſt qualities tempered, and ſo only potential heat, mixt bodies inanimate affecting not the touch with heat; as living, it hath actual heat, by the help of which it exerciſes the functions of life; and this heat, though it be no ingredient of mixtion, and though its operations are performed in a different manner from the operations of mixt heat, yet it is not diſtinguiſhed from it ſpecifically, but onely numerically; as if Pepper be heated in the fire, that acquired actual heat, differs from the heat produced by mixtion, yet both are elementary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the ſecond I reply,</hi> That Brimſtone, Arſenick, and ſuch like, live not through the defect of a ſoul, which is the true and principal Author of life, whereof heat is but onely the inſtrument; but the inſtrumental cauſe acts nothing of it ſelf but at the command of the principal; though that heat proceeding from mixtion, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153522:32"/>before is ſaid, concurs not to the operations of life, but onely the living heat, of which they are deſtitute: So dead carcaſſes have neither ſoul, nor that actual heat; ſo bodies juſt expired retain that heat for ſome time, yet live not, wanting a ſoul: So ſeed is largely fraught with that native heat, though it live not, through defect of a ſoul: though our learned <hi>Neoterikes</hi> judge it to be animate: which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhall be referred to its proper place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the third I anſwer,</hi> That feaveriſh heat is contrary to the native, as it is more intenſe; for an intenſe degree of the ſame quality, in compariſon with a more remiſs, is accounted contrary, becauſe it effects its deſtruction, by raiſing it to intenſity. Beſides, feaveriſh heat is contrary to native, by reaſon of the paſſive quality attending it; for feaveriſh heat is dry, native moiſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we ſhall thus diſoblige our ſelves from the duty we owe to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s authority, that he referred to the effects, not the nature of native heat. But the effects of this heat are almoſt divine, the honour of which is rather to be conferred upon the ſoul and its faculties; though the heat of our fire being temper'd according to Art produceth admirable effects in Chymiſtry: And ſo even in our Culinary fire, as in <hi>Aegypt</hi> (according to the report of <hi>Scaliger</hi>) Eggs are wont to be excluded in ſome Furnaces, ſo artificially built, that the heat of the fire may be in them ſo temperate, that it may be fit to effect gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <p>THIS definition of a <hi>Part</hi> being the moſt ingenious invention of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> was afterwards ratified by the conſent of moſt learned men. For he conſiders a Part as it is related to Medicine, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is capable of health or diſeaſe; and in his opinion, all thoſe deſerve not the name of Parts, which though they concur to conſtitute the body, yet they cannot ſympathize in a Diſeaſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Humors and Spirits have no ſhare in this definition, becauſe they do not wholly cohere, nor participate of a common life. So it extends not to the hairs, nails, fat, and marrow of the bones, which though they wholly cohere, yet they are not ſharers in life, neither are they truly nouriſhed, but onely increaſed by neighbouring poſition; ſo thoſe things which are preternaturally adnate to the body; as gravel, hard skin, and warts, which though they have a total adheſion to the body, yet enjoy no life. So neither are carnous excretions Parts, though they cohere to the whole, and communicate in life, becauſe they are not appointed to any action or uſe.</p>

                  <head type="sub">All Parts are divided into Similar and Diſſimilar. The Similar Parts are they which are divided into Parts of the ſame nature, and not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſpecies.</head>
                  <p>THE Matter of the Parts lends occaſion of this diviſion; for ſome Parts being made of the ſame and every where alike matter, are called <hi>Similar;</hi> but if the matter be diverſe, they fall under the notion of <hi>Diſſimilar.</hi> But we ſay they have a like matter, becauſe at the firſt glance they repreſent themſelves ſo to the ſenſe; ſuch is the ſubſtance of the nerves, whoſe parts appear to ſenſe wholly ſimilar: but yet a curious Scrutiniſt will diſcover ſome diſſimilar parts in them, for their interiour ſubſtance is ſoft and marrowy, but the internal hard and membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. But this difference is not of ſuch validity, nor ſo manifeſt, but that the nerves may find place in the catalogue of Similar parts: <hi>Avicen</hi> defines a Similar part thus, <hi>whoſe parts retain the ſame name and definition with the whole:</hi> So every part of the bone is bone, and every part of the nerve nerve. But you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes apprehend this diſcourſe to ſignifie the matter of the Parts, not their figure or uſe: for in relation to theſe, every particle of them retains not the definition of the whole; for example, a nerve is defined a ſimilary part, white, ariſing from the brain, or the <hi>ſpinalis medulla,</hi> prepared for the communication of motion and ſenſe to the whole body; which definition is not agreeable to every particle of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Similar parts are two, Spermatick and Carnous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſpermatick are produced by the incraſſation of ſeed in the firſt faſhioning of our bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principles of our generation are two, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeed and menſtruous blood, which are the platform of all the parts of our bodies: for ſeed is the Author of thoſe firſt rafters, <hi>viz.</hi> bones, ligaments, tendons, membranes, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Carnous owe their compoſition to blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The carnous parts are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the ſpermatick, becauſe they are red, but theſe white and moſt commonly ſolid and hard; but blood being hot and moiſt, therefore the carnous parts have alſo acquired a temper hot and moiſt: Yet it is not ſo with the ſpermatick parts, which, though ſeed be hot and moiſt, are yet cold and dry, becauſe the calidity of the ſeed depends upon its ſpirits, which convert not into the ſubſtance of the part, but have the title only of efficients in generation; but the moiſture of the ſeed is waſted, that the parts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153522:33"/>generated out of it, may become dry and hard: whence heat ſubſiſting upon moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is diminiſhed proportionally to the diminution of moiſture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fleſh of the ſimilary parts is threefold; of the muſcles, of the bowels, and fleſh properly ſo called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the quantity of the muſculous fleſh is greateſt, for almoſt the whole bulk of the body is compoſed of muſcles, and their ſubſtance is commonly and ſimply termed fleſh, but the ſubſtance of the bowels alſo is called fleſh, and the greater part of them is compoſed of blood alone; yet to the conſtitution of ſome there goes a permixtion of ſeed with blood: ſuch is the ſubſtance of the ventricle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, the wombe, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the due execution of the actions of the ſimilar parts, there is but one condition neceſſary,</hi> viz. <hi>their juſt temper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſimilar parts as ſimilar, and as diſtinguiſhed from the organical, exerciſe onely one action, <hi>viz.</hi> Nutrition, for which cauſe they attract, retain, and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to themſelves their proper and convenient aliment, which cannot be effected but by their temper, for according to the various temper of any part, the aliment muſt be various and diverſly changed; whence a ſimilar action is defined, whoſe original being only from the temper of the part, it is perfected by the ſame, and is wholly and perfectly exerciſed by every punctilio of the part.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Diſſimilar and Organical parts.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">The Diſſimilar parts are thoſe which are divided into parts unlike in nature, and differing in ſpecies.</head>
                  <p>SO the Heart, Liver, Reins, and other parts, are termed Diſſimilar, as being compoſed of many ſimilar parts, <hi>viz.</hi> membranes, veins, arteries, nerves, and a <hi>parenchyma.</hi> So the hand and arm is pieced up of bones, nerves, muſculous fleſh, skin, and the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every Diſſimilar part is Organicall, but every Organicall part is not Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many confound the Organical with the Diſſimilar, ſo that they ſuppoſe it to imply all one, if we divide the parts into ſimilar and organical, as into ſimilar and diſſimilar: But in this they erre, becauſe many ſimilar parts are alſo organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; for the bones, veins, and arteries are ſimilar parts, yet being variouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and exerciſing organical actions, they are uſually called organical: and ſo in relation to their matter they are <hi>ſimilar,</hi> but in reſpect of their form and figure <hi>organical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But an Organical part is that, which by the vertue of its owne conformation acts determinately.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſimilar parts ſimply and ſtrictly conſidered, as being conflated of one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and buſie in one action, <hi>viz.</hi> Nutrition, may ſtand in direct oppoſition to the organical: hence it is common to divide all the actions of our body into ſimilar and organical, and though, as before is noted, there be but one onely ſimilar action,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153522:33"/>yet the organical run almoſt to infinity, as they are various, and particularly want an organ variouſly conformable, this ſignifies a neceſſity of conſtituting many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental parts: Hence is that large catalogue of the parts contrived with ſuch rare artifice, that cauſeth us to ſtand amazed in admiration of the juncture of our own bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To cauſe the action of the organical parts, there are four things neceſſary, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, magnitude, number and conjunction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conformation imports three things; figure, paſſage and cavity, aſperity and laevity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that an organical part ſhould duly perform its action, unleſs it firſt rightly conform, and eſpecially acquire a proper figure; ſo for inſtance, the head ought to be round, the arm long, and ſo forth. Beſides, the parts for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their offices muſt have certain paſſages and cavities: ſo the veins and arteries have their paſſages, the ventricle uſeth the paſſage of the <hi>Eſophagus,</hi> but the cavity is all that ſpace which contains the aliment. Thirdly, ſome parts for their more convenient operation ought to be ſmooth, as the <hi>aſpera arteria,</hi> whoſe interior ſuperficies is ſmooth and polite, for the ſweeter modulation of the voyce; for it is not termed rough, as being unequal and rugged, (according to the uſual acception of that term) but being made up of an unequal, <hi>viz.</hi> cartilaginous and membranous ſubſtance. But it is requiſite ſome parts ſhould be rough and rugged, as the interior ſuperficies of the ventricle, that it may the better contain the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A certain and determinate magnitude alſo is proportioned to every member, requiſite to the exerciſe of its action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Liver is bigger than the Heart, the Brain than the Eye, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But one part of the ſame kind are ſufficient for the exerciſe of certain actions, for others many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So for ſpeech, the tongue onely is requiſite; but to hold any thing, many fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conjunction ſignifies two things,</hi> viz. <hi>ſite, and connexion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the liver is ſituated on the right <hi>hypocondrium,</hi> but the milt in the left; the inteſtines in the middle of the <hi>abdomen,</hi> the wombe between the bladder and the <hi>inteſtinum rectum:</hi> ſo the bones effect motion by their mutual connexion in the joynts: on the contrary, the lips and the eye-lids for the performance of their offices ought not to have any connexion, but are open and ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the organical parts are two; the principal, and the ignoble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The principal are they which are without exception neceſſary for the conſervation of the individual, and are liberal in the diſtribution of faculty and ſpirit to the whole body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And theſe are three; the brain, the heart, and the liver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are in our bodies three faculties, as we ſhall afterwards inſtance; the animal, vital, and natural; every of theſe keeps a peculiar court in peculiar mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in which it is more glorious and majeſtical, and from which in fellowſhip with the ſpirits, which are alſo generated in it, it flows into the whole body: hence theſe parts are nobilitated with the title of Principal. This is the ancient and cuſtomary tenent of School-Phyſicians, which we propoſe for the ſake of young Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from which opinion in the Phyſical Schools it was a ſin to diſſent, though it be inconſiſtent with the aſſertions of the Peripateticks, who obtrude, that the Soul with the train of all its faculties, reſides wholly in the whole, and wholly in every part, therefore there needs no influence of faculties, they dwelling in every part, and operating every where, if they want not convenient inſtruments; which cauſed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to ſay, <hi>If the eye were placed in the foot, the foot would ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:153522:34"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ignoble are they which ſend forth no faculties nor ſpirits, or which are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and vaſſals of the principall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the organs of the ſenſes are framed for the ſake of the brain onely; ſo the lungs, midriffe, and arteries are deſigned to the temper and purgation of the heart; ſo the ventricle, inteſtines, milt, reins, both bladders, are made for the uſe of the liver. To be ſhort, all the parts of the whole body are ignoble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the three principal parts mentioned. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>Ars parva</hi> reckons the teſticles among the principal parts, becauſe they are neceſſary for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſpecies. We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh, that in reſpect of the ſpecies they are principal parts, not in relation to the individuum.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Soul therefore is the ſubſtantial form of a living body, by which we enjoy life, ſenſe, nutrition, underſtanding, and local motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> defines it, the perfection or act of an organical body potentially living, which definition lies invelop'd in obſcure terms, and is a point of nice ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; We therefore ſuppoſe this our definition to be more clear, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for our conduct in the courſe of Phyſick: for man being conſtituted of matter and form, as all other natural bodies, and all his parts being the matter, it is conſequent that the ſoul ſhould be the form. For all actions having a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon the form, and the ſoul being the cauſe and principle of all the actions of a living body, we muſt neceſſarily acknowledg that the ſoul is the form. Hence in the abſence of the ſoul, action ceaſeth. By this means we arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of her by her actions onely, becauſe immaterial ſubſtances are underſtood only by their effects. But theſe various actions are exerciſed by the ſoul, through the help of divers vertues and proprieties, which are the immediate retainers to its Eſſence, and immediately depend upon it, and theſe proprieties are termed facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which we inſtitute our following diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Faculty is a proper and inſeparable accident of the ſoul, which is inſtrumental to it in the execution of certain Functions in the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:153522:34"/>
                  <p>The faculties are accidents referred to the ſecond <hi>ſpecies</hi> of quality. Their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the ſoul, in which they inhere, not as common but as proper and inſeparable accidents: hence <hi>Fernelius</hi> weakly aſſerts them ſeparable from the ſoul, which he endeavours to verify by an inſtance of the auctive faculty, which he affirms to be aboliſhed, when the vigor of Age declines. Yet this faculty is not aboliſhed, but only lies idle for want of Inſtruments: for the whole Aliment is waſted in nutrition, becauſe the body being well grown, requires more nutriment; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat being debilitated cannot operate accretion, of which nature alſo is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful, while it hath filled the body to its due proportion: yet this faculty is not extinct, as neither the procreating faculty in a Child, though it is quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wantonizing, till Youth, when it finds the ſeed elaborated to maturity fit for the exerciſe of its functions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Function is an Active motion, or the effect of a Faculty in any part of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the faculties wait immediately upon the form or the ſoul, ſo the functions upon the faculties, as effects depend upon their cauſes. But in this lies the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the actions and faculties, that they are appropriated to the ſoul, the functions to the whole maſſe: therefore for the exerciſe of action, there is not only required the preſence of the ſoul, with its retinue of faculties, but alſo a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Organ fitted for action, which being diſorderly, the actions are lamely, or not at all exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>But it is obſervable, that in the parts, beſide the action properly ſo called, there are two other things conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Uſe.</hi> The Work is the effect of action, <hi>viz.</hi> when it hath a real and permanent object; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Chyle, which proceeds from concoction in the ventricle, is named the Work, ſo the blood in the Liver. But the uſe of a part is, when it exerts no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it ſelf, but is only auxiliary and commodious to the action of another part, as the meſenterium which is only the pillar ſupporting the meſaraick veins; the epiploon of the ventricle nouriſheth heat, and involves it as a veſtment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Uſe</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from action, becauſe this is perpetually in motion which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in conceit be abſtracted from it; but Uſe is placed in the idleneſs of the part, which ſometimes remains after the deceaſe, as appears by the uſe of the skin, which covers the whole body, and by the skul uſeful to contain the brain.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Faculties and Functions are three-fold; Natural, Vital, and Animal.</head>
                  <p>THE ſpirits were before divided into three differences, every one of which is produced in its peculiar part, and ſtreams from it into the whole body; where we mentioned three parts which are the ſhops of theſe parts, it remains now that we conſtitute three faculties and enthronize them in thoſe parts, which by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of inſtruments, may in them chiefly exerciſe their actions, whoſe actions ought not to exceed in number the faculties, being their effects; and becauſe we attaine not the knowledg of the faculties but by the functions aforeſaid, they were divided into three, becauſe there appear three kind of actions, diſtanced by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153522:35"/>a great latitude, every of which is ſubdivided into its <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as after ſhall appear.</p>
                  <p>But experience doth often inform us, that thoſe three functions, and ſo the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are mutually diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is evident enough by this that the Animal faculty is diſtinguiſhed from the natural, becauſe many parts, as the bones, and cartilages are deſtitute of ſenſe and motion, yet they live and receive nutriment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides,</hi> It is plain by this that there intercedes a difference between the Vital and Animal, becauſe when we ſleep or deſiſt from all operation, yet the heart with the Arteries is in continual agitation, and is in no wiſe obedient to the command of the will. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The diſtinction of the vital from the natural is manifeſt in a part conſumed by an Atrophy, or the whole body in a Maraſmus, which for want of Aliment is pined, yet it lives by the help of a faculty iſſuing from the heart, which defends and preſerves it.</p>
                  <p>Some may <hi>object,</hi> That <hi>Galen in his bookes of the differences of ſymptomes,</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes only two faculties, the Animal and Natural, omitting the Vital. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That <hi>Galen there</hi> underſtands that terme Naturall, at large, for all that which is not voluntary, and ſo comprehends the Vital faculty in the latitude of the Animal, for he there engages himſelf to the ſtrict law of diviſion, which is made, when the members are oppoſite, ſo that in this manner voluntary is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to involuntary: ſeeing then the Animal functions are voluntary, but the Vital and Natural involuntary, and both performed only by the vertue of nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he there expreſſeth both by the term of Natural, though in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he diſtinguiſheth them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Natural faculty is that vertue of the ſoul, by which through the aſſiſtance of native heat the body is nouriſhed, and increaſed, and the ſame according to its <hi>ſpecies</hi> is generated.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence the Function is three-fold, Nutrition, Auction, and Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN Animate bodies three things are very neceſſary, the conſervation of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum,</hi> its juſt proportion, and the conſervation of the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The ſubſtance of the <hi>Individuum</hi> by divers cauſes, as well internal as external, daily moulders away, and ſomething alwayes departs from it, which unleſſe a reſtauration were made by Aliment, life would ſoon be extinct: that therefore this body may be preſerved to while away ſome time, the firſt faculty called <hi>Nutritive</hi> is requiſite. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature hath confined all things to a certain magnitude, convenient for the exerciſe allotted them, the ſecond neceſſary will be the <hi>Auctive</hi> faculty, by the help of which the animate body fils up every particle of that magnitude; whence this virtue propoſeth not for its end the conſervation of the form in the matter, but the operation of the living creature. Laſtly, animate bodies being frail, and ſubject

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Nutritive faculty is that vertue of the ſoul, which by the help of innate heat converts the Aliment into the ſubſtance of the body, to repaire its loſs.</hi>

                     <hi>The Action of this faculty is called Nutrition, which is the inſtauration of that ſubſtance of our bodies which is conſumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Native heat in our bodies is never idle, as is before alleaged, but acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the humidity, which it waſts and diſſolves; therefore leſt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould pine away, and dye, the loſſe muſt be made up, this cauſed that opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that a man cannot ſubſiſt without Aliment ſeven dayes: And ſo Nutrition is proper only to living creatures; for though by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, fire is ſaid to be nouriſhed and increaſed by combuſtible matter, yet this is no true Nutrition, but only improperly ſo called: for there are three things requiſite to true nutrition and accretion, according to the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle; Firſt,</hi> That a thing be nouriſhed and increaſed by the acceſs of external matter; <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the thing increaſed remain numerically the ſame; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this acceſſe of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude accrew not only to the whole, but to every particle thereof: But now in the nutrition of the fire, it remains not in its numerical identity, but by reaſon of the combuſtible matter is continually ſucceſſive, neither is every particle thereof compleat with the addition of magnitude, and for this cauſe, true and proper nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is not agreeable to fire, but by Analogy only.</p>
                  <p>It may be <hi>objected,</hi> That if the Aliment in Nutrition convert into the ſubſtance of the parts, there is no intervening difference between nutrition and generation. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That there is no real, but only a rational diſtinction between them, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the diverſity between the whole and a part, for nutrition is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a part of the ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of that ſmall part of the fleſh which is waſted; but generation is of the whole fleſh, and the total ſubſtance: This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philoſophers term an <hi>adgeneration of the parts,</hi> but the other is ſimply na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The nutritive faculty is attended with foure ſervants; the attractive, retentive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctive, and expulſive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And their actions are, attraction, retention, concoction, and expulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every of theſe is twofold; one official, the other private.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The official is that which is not only ſubſervient in the nutrition of the part in which it is exerciſed, but alſo of the whole body. But the private is onely ſervitor to that part in which it is exerciſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parts which exert official actions, are ſaid to exerciſe publick duty, the reſt private: So the ventricle and liver are official in their actions, as attracting, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, concocting, and expelling the aliment, not for the nouriſhment of themſelves only, but alſo of the whole body; but the mouth, the fleſh, and ſuch like, do only act privately, as attracting aliment only ſufficient for their own nutrition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The attractive faculty is that virtue of the ſoul, by which the parts attract their uſual aliment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the parts not being of one and the ſame ſubſtance nor temperament, any ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equally fit for their nutrition, but every part attracts that which is to it ſelf moſt convenient, by that faculty which is the handmaid of the nutritive, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is called the attractive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Private attraction is cauſed by heat and ſiccity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the official, partly by thoſe qualities, partly by the direct fibres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All natural actions proceed from the temper, though not all from the ſame;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153522:36"/>but as they are divers, ſo they delight in variety of temperament. Yet it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that all are helped by heat, though they be ſometimes ſociable with humidity, ſometimes with ſiccity. And ſo the attraction of every ſingular part is ſtrengthened by heat and ſiccity, and performed by them alone, which is to be underſtood of private attraction; for official actions are not exerciſed by the temper alone, but they muſt neceſſarily uſe a due diſpoſition of inſtruments, and ſo official attraction is not onely performed by the aforementioned qualities, but alſo by direct fibres which by their contraction inſinuate the aliment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The retentive faculty is that virtue of the ſoul, by which the parts retain the attracted aliment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parts invite by attraction the aliment as their familiar and acquaintance, and therefore attract it, that they might enjoy the company of ſo dear a friend; which cannot be effected, unleſſe they retain it for ſome ſpace: this then implies the neceſſity of another quality, by whoſe help the aliment may be retained in every part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Private retention is exerciſed by calidity and ſiccity, as alſo attraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But official is performed, not onely by theſe qualities, but alſo by oblique fibres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The natural parts on which it is incumbent to exerciſe official actions, are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with three kinds of fibres, direct, oblique, and tranſverſe, by the help of the direct attraction is performed, of the oblique retention, of the tranſverſe expulſion, as afterwards ſhall appear. But all theſe fibres officiate their duties by ſelf-contraction; as all the muſcles when they agitate the parts by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious motions, uſually perform it by a retreat, contracting them towards their principle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The concoctive faculty is that virtue of the ſoul, by which the parts change and aſſimilate to themſelves the aliment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we ſay that our meat is then concocted in the ventricle, liver, and other parts, when in colour, ſmell, taſte, and firſt qualities, as alſo in ſubſtance it is aſſimilated to the parts, which was the mind of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, <hi>Book</hi> 8. <hi>of Compoſition of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,</hi> where he terms concoction alteration, which proceeds ſo far, till the aliment be changed into a reſemblance to the part: Where alſo he inſtructeth us in the difference between <hi>concoction</hi> and <hi>nutrition,</hi> for concoction is an aſſimilation, but nutrition is an union of that which is aſſimilated. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines concoction, <hi>a perfection ariſing from the natural and proper heat by oppoſite paſſives;</hi> which defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too Philoſophical, and extends too far, nor doth ſo nearly touch upon the nature of thoſe coctions which are performed in our bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every concoction in our body is perfected by heat and moiſture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers propoſe three ſpecies of concoction: <hi>Maturation,,</hi> which is the concoction in fruits: <hi>Aſſation,</hi> which is by the heat of fire; and <hi>Elixation,</hi> by heat and moiſture. That concoction which is performed in our bodies, is a kind of elixation, or an alteration like to elixation, for it is cauſed by our native heat, tempered with much moiſture: So the aliments, for the more convenient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, ought to be well drench'd with moiſture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That official concoction is performed onely by theſe qualities, and ſtands not in need of any fibres, as the other three actions ſubſervient to Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But concoction in our body is threefold,</hi> viz. <hi>Chylification, Sanguification, Aſſimilation. Chylification is performed in the Ventricle, Sanguification in the Liver, and Aſſimilation in every part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner of theſe Coctions and their Excrements, were treated <hi>in the Section
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153522:36"/>of humors;</hi> which Expoſition, if it be not copious enough for the ſatisfaction of any ones deſires, and the controverſies agitated concerning it; let ſuch an one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to <hi>Andreas Laurentius</hi> in his <hi>Anatomical Hiſtory,</hi> where he may find all of them largely and perſpicuouſly handled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Concoction of this kind we muſt take ſpecial notice of a Theoreme conſented to by Philoſophers and Phyſicians,</hi> viz. <hi>that all concoction is cauſed by incraſſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In good concoction moiſture is joyned with ſiccity, and the humid parts more convenient for nouriſhment, are united to the terrene alimentary parts; but the more thin and diſſipable part of moyſture is conſumed by the action of heat, hence coction is produced by incraſſation.</p>
                  <p>But theſe ſequels ſeem to force our judgement to a contrary ſentence: For <hi>firſt,</hi> Chyle produced out of bread is thinner than bread, blood than chyle, ſpirits than blood, which conſequentially derive their original from them. <hi>Beſides,</hi> if urine be more thin or craſs, it is termed crude, therefore coction conſiſts in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moderation of the ſubſtance, and not in craſſity. To <hi>the firſt I give this anſwer;</hi> that is, In every coction the craſs excrements are excluded; from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of which, the tenuity of the reſt of the alimentary maſs proceeds; yet this diſtinct by it ſelf, and from the excrements, is incraſſated, and this alſo is onely termed concoct, the reſt is ſet apart as uſeleſs; for theſe exiles are not properly the ſubject matter of coction, but that onely ought to be termed the ſubject of coction, which after the departure of the excrements is fit for concoction; from which the excrements being totally ſeparated, it is evident that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, in that whole interval in which coction is performed, the action of heat ſhould cauſe ſome effluxion, and ſo the incraſſation of the thing which is concocting. <hi>To the ſecond I reply,</hi> That the urine, which by reaſon of too much thickneſs is termed crude, is not in its proper ſubſtance inclined to this craſſity, but by the permixtion of ſome other craſs thing, not ſeparated through ſome defect in concoction, which by the aſſiſtance of heat is wont to baniſh things hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The expulſive faculty is that, by which the parts after concoction expel things of no uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that is attracted by the parts, cannot be wholly conſubſtantiated with them, but there alwayes remains ſomething which eſtranges it ſelf, and will not accept of the benefit of concoction, which therefore ought to be removed as ſtrange and ſuperfluous, which for this reaſon is called <hi>Excrement.</hi> This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then was requiſite to turn out of dores this alien, leſt it ſhould contrive any thing prejudicious to nature. The official parts alſo drive out not the excrements onely, but the uſeful ſubſtance, being unable to naturalize all the aliment, after they have for ſome time entertained it, and pleaſur'd themſelves in it, they thruſt it away to other parts as a burdenſome ſuperfluity, and uſeleſs maſs. And for this reaſon the very alimentary ſubſtance is called uſeful excrement, in relation to the parts expelling it, becauſe whatever is expelled or caſt out, is in a common ſpeech uſually termed Excrement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Private expulſion is cauſed by heat and ſiccity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But official, partly by thoſe qualities, partly by tranſverſe fibres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no cauſe of admiration in any one, why attraction, retention, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, being actions widely differing, ſhould be performed by the ſame qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> calidity and ſiccity; for this doth peculiarly evidence, that we muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an higher cauſe of actions then the temper, which is onely the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the form: So an Artiſt by one and the ſame inſtrument operates variouſly,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153522:37"/>though it is undeniable, that divers degrees of heat and dryneſs are requiſite to divers actions which yet fall not under our knowledge.</p>
                  <p>But the tranſverſe fibres are very commodious for official expulſion, becauſe eſpecially by their contraction they crone up the part, and compreſſion is the cauſe of expulſion.</p>
                  <div type="corollary">
                     <head>A COROLLARY.</head>
                     <p>Many hold the Number of faculties and functions attending on nutrition to be imperfect and deficient, becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> and other Authors enlarge this catalogue with many Additions, but how many functions ſoever are found, we muſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the faculties which are their cauſes to equalize them in number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſerves up two courſes of appetency in the ventricle, not Animal, only perceptible to the ſenſe, and named hunger: but alſo natural; by which through a natural appetite we deſire convenient Aliment; this appetite no part of the body wants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, Galen</hi> addes to the before rehearſed qualities the ſecretive and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, for <hi>in the firſt of nat. fac.</hi> when he had informed us that the concoctive was in the veins and parts, he further inſiſts, that a ſecretive faculty is neceſſary, which might ſegregate things ſuperfluous and uſeleſs from the uſeful, and expel them: And <hi>in the 5. of cauſes of ſymptomes,</hi> he recites ſymptomes contingent by ſome error in ſecretion, and diſtribution, the Jaundies proceeding from a defect in ſecretion, Atrophy from vitiated diſtribution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Appoſition and aſſimilation differ from the reſt before mentioned, therefore their number muſt be multiplyed.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the firſt I anſwer,</hi> That appetency is not really diſtinct from attraction, but the difference onely conſiſts in the nicety of underſtanding, for this vertue is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted not to attract promiſcuouſly, but with choice, <hi>viz.</hi> of that which bears a friendly compliance with the parts.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the ſecond I anſwer,</hi> That diſtribution and ſecretion are not diſtinct, but rather mixt faculties, conſequential to the operations of the other. For the diſtribution of the Aliment thorough the whole body is effected by the other parts expelling it, in which humors are copious, and others attracting which want humor as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf atteſts, and ſo it depends partly from the faculty attractive, partly from the expulſive. So alſo ſecretion is uſually cauſed, when the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty of the parts keeps that which is of uſe, and the expulſive expells that which is uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>the third I anſwer,</hi> That appoſition and aſſimilation proceed not from any peculiar faculty, but only are various degrees of concoction, ſo that through its <hi>mediums</hi> it is in progreſſe from the firſt motion of its alteration to the perfection of aſſimilation.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon why <hi>Galen</hi> propoſeth them all in proper and diſtinct terms, is for the clearer underſtanding them, not that they are really diſtinct from the other actions.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Auctive faculty, and of Accretion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Auctive faculty is that virtue of the ſoul, by which the body upon converſion of aliment into its ſubſtance, fils up its dimenſions, and to arrives a due proportion, convenient for the exerciſe of actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence Auction or Accretion is an extenſion of the body into every dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>viz.</hi> long, broad, profound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HEnce ariſeth that diſtinction of <hi>Natural</hi> from <hi>Artificial</hi> Accretion, for thoſe things which are augmented or extended by Art, loſe ſo much of their longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as they acquire in latitude, and the contrary. But true accretion is in this manner differenced from <hi>pinguefaction,</hi> becauſe pinguefaction extends not it ſelf to all dimenſions, but moſt to profundity. It is alſo diſtinguiſhed from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſtones and metals, which is by <hi>oppoſition,</hi> not by an intrinſecal dilatation of the parts, from aliment converted by nutrition, for auction deviates not from nutrition, but the parts receive augmentation from the ſame matter that they receive nutrition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet though Accretion proceeds in the ſame courſe as Nutrition, it is really diſtinct from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This auctive faculty is of ſuch neceſſary alliance to the nutritive, that without the aſſiſtance of it, it cannot be compleat; upon which ground many have been moved to aſſert them one and the ſame faculty, therefore the auctive enjoyeth no ſingularity of action different from the nutritive, but when ſo much is acquired by the prepared aliment, as was carried away by quotidian effluxions, then the body is ſaid to be ſimply nouriſhed, but when the income is greater, then it is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and increaſed: But addition or diminution change not the ſpecies of the action; therefore the auctive faculty differs not from the nutritive, having one and the ſame object, <hi>viz.</hi> nutriment.</p>
                  <p>But yet we may for certain conclude, that theſe two faculties are ſet at a large diſtance; for proof of which there are many arguments: For <hi>firſt,</hi> they agree not in their propoſed end, for the end of the nutritive is the reſtoring of the parts waſted, but of the auctive an acquiſition of due proportion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they differ in form, for the form of nutrition is the union of the aliment, but of accretion a motion of extention. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they are diſtinct in the manner of their muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for in nutrition there happens no local mutation of the body, but that which is augmented changeth place, for it fills up more room. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they are differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in conſideration of time, for nutrition is at all times, but accretion hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time of duration.</p>
                  <p>But that accretion proceeds not from the copiouſneſs of aliment, <hi>viz.</hi> after nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition performed, will in this convincingly appear, becauſe experience ſhews that they grow and fill, who uſe but little nutrition, as is evident in boys and youths diſeaſed, who though they be very lean, are yet continually growing, becauſe at ſuch age the auctive faculty is moſt efficacious, and ſo potent, that it plunders the nutritive it ſelf of aliment, conveying it chiefly to the ſolid parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the bones, by the extenſion of which the whole body is extended, therefore the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153522:38"/>by virtue of the auctive faculty is carried to theſe parts, and the carnous parts are defrauded of their due nutriment: Hence thoſe that are in growth, appear lean: On the contrary we find many fat, and well ſtuffed, and fed with high delicacies, which yet arrive not to a due or decent procerity of body.</p>
                  <p>But though to the auctive and nutritive faculties the ſame object is propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> nutriment, yet they uſe this object in divers relations. For the nutritive uſeth it as it tends ſimply to the conſervation of the ſubſtance of the part. But the auctive as it is directed to heighten the ſubſtance to a juſt magnitude and quantity. For though the ſubſtance acquired by nutrition, have quantity, it being impoſſible for a material ſubſtance to be deſtitute of quantity: yet nutrition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not the ſubſtance as it hath quantity, but as it is a ſubſtance; but accretion is related to it, not as a ſubſtance, but as having quantity. So, for example, as the blood is incarnated, ſo far goes nutrition, reſpecting only the ſubſtance of the fleſh, but as blood is changed into a greater proportion of fleſh, here enters accretion, regarding not the ſubſtance of the fleſh, but only its quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The end of accretion is not commenſurated by life, but accretion is moſt uſually exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to twenty five, or thirty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nature hath meaſured out a certain proportion to every living body, therefore a living body is ſo long in a tendency to augmentation, as it is in attaining to this determination of time. But when it is augmented to a compleat magnitude, in obedience to the command of Nature, it ſtops there, and makes no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Beſides, becauſe accretion immediately depends upon the extenſion of the ſolid parts, according to the three dimenſions, the ſequel will be, that a body doth ſo long increaſe, as the parts thereof may in this manner be extended. But now in the courſe of our life, the ſolid parts are ſo hardened and dryed, through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual reſolution of primigenious moiſture, occaſioned by the action of native heat, that they will no longer yeeld to extenſion.</p>
                  <p>But though the auctive faculty after the limitation aforeſaid, operates no more, yet we muſt not aſſert it corrupted or idle, as ſome fancyed; it being not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the faculties of the ſoul ſhould be alwayes ſecondly actual, and in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for in our apprehenſion generation and local motion is not ever actual, and therefore alſo there is no neceſſity of a continual growth, but the faculties, upon their arrival to their appointed end, repoſe themſelves. So the auctive reſts upon the aſſecution of its end, <hi>viz.</hi> the due ſtature of magnitude. After that it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in its operation, having no fit ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> a body not diſpoſed to an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for extenſion. The cauſe therefore ſprouts into two branches, one taken from the end, the other from the ſubject.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>GEneration, according to the Philoſophers, is twofold, Univocal, and Equivocal. That is termed <hi>Univocal,</hi> when every thing generates ſomething reſembling it ſelf, ſuch is the generation of all perfect animals. <hi>Equivocal</hi> is when things of a various and diſſenting nature are generated, ſuch is the generation of imperfect animals, whoſe wombe is putrefaction: Therefore univocal generation is principally applicable to perfect animals: Hence Mules and Eunuchs are not fit for generation. By this it appears that the name of Generation is not uſed in ſo large a ſenſe by the Phyſicians as by Philoſophers, who call all introduction of form into matter, Generation; but here it is taken onely for the production of a like thing, which is alſo called <hi>procreation.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Vital faculty.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">The Vital faculty is that virtue of the Soul, by which the vital ſpirits are generated in the heart, and life is preſerved in the whole body.</head>
                  <p>THE Spirits plainly demonſtrate that there is in the Soul a peculiar faculty diſtinct from the reſt, which from the fountain of the heart copiouſly flow into the Arteries, but every ſpirit is the inſtrument of ſome faculty. But this faculty generates Vital ſpirits in the heart, which ſpirits are the ſubjects of the influent heat, which two communicate themſelves to every part of the body, the heat whereof with the implanted ſpirit they preſerve. But life neceſſarily depending upon implanted heat, the conſervation of it will be the conſervation of life; hence this faculty is ſignificantly termed Vital, or the preſervative of life. And ſo life is an action depending upon this faculty as an effect upon its cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Vital faculty is attended by two ſervants, Pulſe, and Reſpiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ignorantly aſſerted by ſome, that the Pulſe is the chief of Vital actions, and immediately to depend upon the Vital faculty: for life, as we before affirmed, immediately depends upon that, but the pulſe is only a ſubſervient action to it, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a pulſifick faculty, whoſe vertue is only to cauſe ſyſtole and diaſtole in the heart, by which means it performs its duty to the Vital faculty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pulſe is a function of the heart and Arteries, compoſed of Syſtole and Diaſtole with ſome interpoſition of reſt, cauſed by the pulſifick faculty of the heart, to further the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Vital ſpirits, and effect the diſtribution of them thorough the whole body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pulſe of the heart and Arteries is compoſed of three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> diaſtole, ſyſtole and the interceſſion of a pauſe. By <hi>Diaſtole</hi> the heart and Arteries are impregnate. When the heart dilates it ſelfe, it attracts the Aire from the Lungs by the help of the Arteria Venoſa, and the blood from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> that from the commiſtion of them in the left cloſet of the heart, the ſpirits may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but the Arteries being ſtrtech'd to a dilatation, attract the ſpirits from the heart, and are tumid with them, as alſo the external Aire, entertained by thoſe orifices which are terminated in the skin; and in this manner <hi>is tranſpiration</hi> cauſed, which by this intromiſſion of external aire fixes the internal heat to a due temperament, and cheriſhes it, for all heat is preſerved by a moderate compliance of cold, according to <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Syſtole</hi> or contraction, the heart by the aſſiſtance of the Arteria venoſa, purges out at the Lungs, all the fuliginous excrements left in the generation of ſpirits. For the Arteries by an inſenſible tranſpiration drive out the fuliginous vapors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, and ſend the ſpirits more copiouſly to the parts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there mediate between the ſyſtole and diaſtole and <hi>interceſſive</hi> quiet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a tranſition from one contrary to another cannot be effected but by a <hi>medium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A doubt</hi> may be moved, whether the ſpirit and blood contained in the heart moves upon its coarctation: <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> that there are two doores in the heart, one in the right corner, another in the left; which are dilated, when the heart is contracted, and are ſo filled, <hi>viz.</hi> the right with blood contained in the right ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; but the left with ſpirits contained in the left.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:153522:39"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three things are requiſite to cauſe pulſation; Faculty, Inſtrument and Uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt neceſſary is a pulſifick faculty, which is the primary and principal agent; Secondly, inſtruments diſpoſed to pulſation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart and Arteries, moved by that faculty. Thirdly, uſe and neceſſity forcing the faculty to action, <hi>viz.</hi> the generation of ſpirits, and conſervation of native heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſpiration is an action, partly Animal, partly Natural; by which the Aire is uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thorough the mouth to the Lungs; by the diſtention of the breaſt, and by the contraction of the ſame, the ſmoaky vapors are excluded for the conſervation of Native heat, and the generation of Vital ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parts of Reſpiration and of Pulſation are three, <hi>Inſpiration, expiration, and immediate quiet.</hi> By inſpiration the breaſt is dilated by the muſcles, deſtin'd to this office, and in compliance with the dilatation of the breaſt, the lungs are alſo dilated, leſt there ſhould happen a vacuity in that cavity; and the lungs are filled with air, as bellowes, the inſpiration of which aire tempers the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of the heart, and thence the vital ſpirits are generated, as is before urged. But by expiration the breaſt and lungs are contracted, which by their contraction turn out of doores the hot aire and fuliginous vapors iſſuing from the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The concurrence of three things is neceſſary for expiration, Faculty, Inſtrument, &amp; Uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Animal faculty concurs, moving the muſcles of the breaſt, as alſo the natural implanted faculty cauſing motion in the lungs, that they might be helpful to the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a concurrence of inſtruments as all the parts deſigned for Reſpiration. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> uſe or neceſſity of Reſpiration, for the ventilation of the heat in the heart.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Animal faculty is that vertue of the ſoul, which moveth a man to the exerciſe of ſenſe, Auction, and other principal functions of the mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The principal are three, Imagination, Ratiocination, and Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Imagination is that action of the Soul, by which the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of every object offered to the external ſenſes is made perceptible, and diſtinctly diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>EVery ſenſe enjoyeth its proper and peculiar object, (as ſhall after appear) whoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> it entertains in its proper organ, without paſſing judgment of it, for this is the prerogative of the Imagination only, to which the ſpirits preſents the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153522:40"/>ſpecies, conveyed by the nerves from the brain to the inſtruments of the ſenſes. The brain therefore being the Court of the principal faculties, while the objects of divers ſenſes promiſcuouſly reſort to it, they are firſt repreſented, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the imagination, which the peculiar ſenſes are not able to perform; for inſtance, the whiteneſs of milk is only repreſented to the ſight, but not the ſweetneſs of it, on the contrary the ſweetneſs is repreſented to the taſte, not the whiteneſs: But they are both together perceptible to imagination, which rightly diſtinguiſheth to what ſenſe they be related. Beſides imagination apprehends not only things preſent, as the ſenſes, but things abſent alſo, and repreſents them to the mind, compoſing many things never exiſtent, yet in Analogy to thoſe which are apparent to the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers divide thoſe operations of the mind, which we conſenting to <hi>Galen</hi> include under the notion of imagination, into two ſpecies, <hi>viz.</hi> into the common ſenſe, and into fantaſy or imagination; commanding (as it were) the common ſenſe to welcome only the ſpecies of preſent objects, but the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to propoſe to it ſelf things abſent, as if they were really preſent, as alſo things not in being, and impoſſibilities. But ſeeing that they differ only in the method of their operation, it is not neceſſary, that they ſhould depend upon faculties differing in ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ratiocination is that action of the ſoul, by which a man diſcourſes, underſtands and reaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is appropriate to man, the others being enjoyed alſo by brutes. But this receives the ſpecies of things from the imagination, dividing and compounding them, and unravelling their nature, by the help of diſcourſe, diſtinguiſhing good from bad, truth from falſity, drawing out of them many things, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by ſenſe, which yet our mind knows to be certainly true. This is the head of all ſciences, which by the efficacious vertue of this faculty are uſually learned and taught.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Memory is that operation of the ſoul, which retains and preſerves the received ſpecies of things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpecies of things when they are once hedged in to the mind, are there long detained, ſo that after a large ſpace of time, when they have been entertained by the ſenſes, they are repreſented to the mind and imagination, This cauſed the invention of a third faculty diſtinct from the reſt, which might preſerve all thoſe ſpecies, as a treaſury, out of which they may be fetched as occaſion ſerves.</p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers create another operation different from the memory, <hi>viz. reminiſcency,</hi> which ſummons up thoſe things that are run away from the memory, rallying them together by the help of thoſe which are yet retained. But yet we are inclinable to aſſert with <hi>Galen,</hi> that reminiſcency is an operation of the memory reflecting upon it ſelf. For it is not, as ſome conceive, the only buſineſs of the memory to retain the ſpecies: (for by this means it would be a vertue not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only lodging the ſpecies) but it is the office of the memory to record things, as they are tranſacted, and ſo <hi>reminiſcence</hi> is a progreſſive motion, not a differing action of the memory,</p>

                  <head type="sub">To the internal functions of the Brain, are referred Sleeping and Waking: we muſt therefore now treat of them.</head>
                  <p>ALL the Philoſophers referre Sleeping and Waking to the common ſenſe. Poſitively aſſerting ſleep to be the ceſſation of the common and exterior ſenſes; but watching to be the action and exercitation of them: Hence when wee comprehend the common ſenſe under imagination, when alſo dreams (of which we ſhall after treat) may be circled into imagination ſtrictly accepted, therefore this place will be convenient for this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Sleep is a quietation or ceſſation of the internal and external ſenſes, appointed for the recreation of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watch is nothing elſe, but the free exerciſe of the ſame ſenſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Interior ſenſes we chiefly underſtand that internal action, by the help of which the ſpecies are received, which by the external ſenſes are conducted to the imagination: for that operation ſleeps with us, but not the action of imagination, ratiocination, or memory; which are not ſeldome exerciſed in ſleep. Nay the ſenſes themſelves do not wholly compoſe themſelves to ceſſation; for in ſleep we receive violent objects, as noyſes, ratlings, and ſuch like; and ſo, though ſleep be called a privation, and watching an habit, yet it is no total privation, but ſuch an one which eaſily gives way to a retreat from it ſelf to the habit, and by this means it comes ſhort of the eſſence of true privation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next and immediate cauſe of ſleep is the locking up of the ſpirits, and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their influence into the inſtruments of ſenſe and motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the influence of the ſpirits is block'd up by ſwarmes of vapors ſuffocating the brain, which barricadoe the paſſages thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cauſe of natural and quiet ſleep is a gentle, and as it were roride vapour, exhaling from the aliments into the brain, ſtopping up the ventricles and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it, for the retention of the ſpirits and quietation of animal actions. But that ſleep is induced by ſuch like vapors mounting into the brain, it is evident, becauſe the copiouſneſs of meat and drink, wine eſpecially, caſts us into a long and deep ſleep, but theſe ſend up many vapors into the brain. But they who are very ſober, and faſt, ſleep little, by reaſon of the paucity of vapors making to the brain, which are ſoon diſſipated; for the ſleep ceaſeth when the native heat hath diſperſed thoſe vapors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thoſe things ſtop the influence of the ſpirits, which either much diſſipate or dull them, or any other way fix them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principal cauſe of ſleep prohibiting the influx of the ſpirits, is the plenty of vapors randezvouzing in the brain. Yet there may be afforded many other cauſes, producing the ſame with leſs efficacy, or at leaſt not ſo naturally; for inſtance, when the animal ſpirits are ſo tyred by the labour of the day, more ſerious thoughts of the mind, ſtudies and cares, ſo that all their forces rallyed together will not be able to effect an ordinary influx, but nature retains them, and the influent heat, to repair the loſs of the ſpirits; So alſo cold things taken or applyed, intercept and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153522:41"/>ſolidate the ſpirits, as it were to a congelation. And the ſpirits do not ſeldome make a ſtop at ſuch things as delight the mind, as pleaſant Songs, the alluſion of bubbling waters, an intermiſſion of cogitations, ſecurity of the mind, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, the end of ſleep is the inſtauration of the animal ſtrength, and of the whole body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief deſigne of ſleep is to reſtore the animal powers to their vigour, becauſe they being over-wrought by a tedious and various ſenſation, are by the help of ſleep enlivened, and the ſpirits exhauſted by watching are ſtrengthned, the members wearied with motion return to their former nature and functions. Secondarily, alſo ſleep conduceth to the better effecting of natural actions, which by animal operations are in watching in a manner hindred: For in the time we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to ſleep, the heat retires to the inner parts, which is advantagious to concoction, and now new matter is afforded for generation of ſpirits, the excrements are mitigated, diminiſhed, and better concocted.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A Dream is a glancing apparition of ſome ſenſible thing, repreſented to an animal in the time of ſleep.</head>
                  <p>WHile an animal wakes, and exerciſes the external ſenſes, repreſentations from ſenſible objects are conveyed to the brain, that there being imprinted, by the virtue of the animal ſpirits, they might be preſerved. When therefore this animal ſleeps, and releaſes to his external ſenſes, then theſe repreſentations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the animal ſpirits be obſcured and obliterated with ſome dregs or diſturbance of violent motion, do again preſent themſelves, and appear in ſleep: This is the cauſe that the animal judgeth it ſelf really to know by the outward ſenſes thoſe things which are objected onely in ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>Dreams uſually viſit us in the morning, becauſe then after perfect digeſtion the animal ſpirit is more pure, the craſs vapors being reſolved and diſpelled by native heat; now therefore the ſpecies of things are preſented, and ſtated before the imagination more clearly, and perfectly; for as in troubled waters we perceive either none, or a very uncomely effigies, ſo the brain muddied with ſuch plenty of vapors, gives place to the effigiating of no dreams, or of very confuſed and broken ones.</p>

                     <hi>The leſs principal Faculties are two, the one cauſing ſenſation, the other motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Senſitive faculty is that virtue of the ſoul, by which externall objects upon the interceſſion of a fit medium are received in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per organs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The action of this faculty is called ſenſe, or ſenſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOURE things are requiſite to effect Senſation: Firſt, an orderly diſpoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: Secondly, a proportionate object: Thirdly, a medium, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyeth the ſpecies, from the ſenſible thing: Fourthly, a convenient diſtance between the object and the ſenſe, that it may be rightly perceived.</p>
                  <p>The ſpecies of it are five; Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, and Touching.</p>
                  <p>Seeing is a ſenſe, by the help of which a man with his eyes perceives a viſible object through a tranſparent medium actually illuminated.</p>
                  <p>Hearing is a ſenſe by which a man perceives with his ears an audible object, through a ſonorous medium, that is, a medium fitted for the conducting of ſound.</p>
                  <p>Smelling is a ſenſe by which a man perceives at his noſtrils an object of ſmell, by a fit medium.</p>
                  <p>Taſte is a ſenſe by which a man perceives with his tongue the object of Taſte, by a diſpoſed medium.</p>
                  <p>Touch is a ſenſe by which a man with any carnous and nervous part of his body perceives a tangible object, by a prepared medium.</p>
                  <p>The motive faculty is that vertue of the ſoul, by which a man in his owne ſtrength performs local motion.</p>
                  <p>All theſe leſs principal faculties and functions are ſo exactly declared in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, that we think it needleſs to allow them room for expoſition.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Two Sexes are requiſite to the Procreation of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> male and female; by whoſe mutual congreſs the prolifical ſeed is effuſed by both, from which being received in the cavity of the wombe, the firſt Sciography of the offspring is delineated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mans ſeed is a humid and ſpiritous ſubſtance, well wrought in the teſticles, from the aliment left of the third concoction, containing potentially the form of man, concurring not only virtually but materially to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the parts of the infant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is an aſſertion commonly obtruded by many, That ſeed is generated by blood alone, operated in the Liver: grounding upon this, becauſe they find the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spermatick veſſels tumified with blood, as other veins, and becauſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much coition cauſeth an effluxion of blood. But this matter being to bear the force and impreſſe of the whole body, ſo that we commonly attribute the ſimilitude of Children to their Parents to this; we think the aſſertion more proper, that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from every part, from the aliment glean'd from the third concoction, which being not much changed by the parts, there is no cauſe of admiration, that it retains the idea of blood. Yet it cannot be ſuppoſed that every little particle comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rather by thought, then ſenſe, ſhould afford this matter, but all the ſimilar parts, which are called the ſenſible Elements of our body, but from the principal eſpecially, which can ſupply us with thoſe vivifying ſpirits, which repreſent the idea, and character of the whole.</p>
                  <p>But to that <hi>objection,</hi> that the blood iſſues by tedious venery: I <hi>anſwer,</hi> That the ſeminal nature not yet elaborated in the teſticles reſembles blood, being made out of it, ſomewhat changed in the parts, and before obtaining elaboration in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the ſeed there are two parts, Spirit and Thickneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeed by the help of ſpirits is impoſtumate and frothy, it ſwels, becauſe the ſpirits are much in motion and ſtirring: it is frothy, becauſe by the ſame ſpirits as by aire it becomes tumid, and by their motion is agitated. But in this ſpiritous matter reſides the formative faculty, by which a man engenders according to his own ſimilitude. But the thickneſs is the humid and watery ſubſtance, which is manifeſtly evident when the ſpirits have bid adue to the ſeed, for then it looſeth its ſpumoſity, and whiteneſs, and that humid ſubſtance is the matter of all the ſolid parts, and their firſt ſtep to a being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The efficient cauſe of generation is brooded in the ſpiritous part, but the material in the incraſſated part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This affords cauſe of <hi>objection</hi> to the Philoſophers, that one and the ſame thing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153522:42"/>cannot be agent and patient, therefore both cauſes cannot be placed in the ſeede. To which <hi>I oppoſe,</hi> That the aſſertion of this objection would hold good, if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſeed were wholly Homogeneous, but it being compoſed of divers parts, it will not be inconvenient, that it ſhould execute divers offices: for as it is ſpiritous, it acts upon, and informs that more humid and craſſe ſubſtance applyed to it for its matter, and as it were its ſubject, as experience points out to us, in the ſeeds of Plants, and in Eggs: in which ſeeds of plants after they have derived heat from the earth, or the eggs from the incubation of the Hen the prolifical ſpirit is raiſed, which acting upon the matter of the ſame ſeeds or eggs, endeavours and perfects the conformation of the parts. In artificials the efficient or Artiſt enters not into the thing made, or the work, becauſe his buſineſs lies in the external parts: But Nature ſituate in the very marrow of every thing, perfects both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external, and penetrates the whole ſubſtance of its work, dwelling upon it, as in its proper manſion: This clears the doubt, and demonſtrates, that the efficient and the matter for generation of the embryo, find both room in the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But though the ſeed by it ſelf perfects the generation of the infant, yet it is not actually, but onely potentially animate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have been of opinion that the ſeed is actually animate, and hath that form, which afterwards muſt inform the whole fabrick furniſhed with inſtruments. But we ſuppoſe that the ſeed of man doth onely potentially contain the form of man. For the ſoul of man being extrinſecally adventitious, we cannot affirm, that the ſeed comprehends the humane ſoul onely potentially, as it hath an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to induce thoſe diſpoſitions which are requiſite for the entertainment of a more noble form: So neither in other living creatures muſt we imagine the ſeed to be actually animate, but potentially onely, becauſe it hath that conformative power contained in the ſpirit, by which it generates according to its own likeneſs, when the ſeed is laid in a convenient place, and hath ſubject matter. But it is no abſurdity to affirm ſuch a power given to the form of ſeed, there being found in many inanimate things, as in load-ſtones, rubarb, and the like, many and notable faculties, which have not the advantage of any influence from a ſoul. Yet this point of doctrine is very intricate, and notably fenced with difficulties, which <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſhews us <hi>in his Philoſophical Hypomnema's.</hi> Corruption therefore ſeiſeth on the form of the ſeed upon the firſt arrival of the ſoul to the body, now faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and prepared to welcome this gueſt: which is ſaid to live the life of a plant, ſo long as it is ſimply nouriſhed, but when the organs of ſenſe and motion are compleat, it lives an animal or ſenſitive life; and laſtly, proceeds to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a rational ſoul, when it hath acquired a well tempered brain, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſpirits.</p>

                     <p>There hath been a long-ſtarted controverſie between Phyſicians and Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, whether women afford prolifical ſeed: For all the Phyſicians after <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> obtrude the affirmative: for the defence of which they appeal to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience of women, who relate, that in that coition by which they conceived, they ſent out ſomething cauſing more pleaſure. Which alſo the contrivance of feminine parts will ſerve to confirm, Nature having placed in them very large teſticles for the elaboration of the ſeed, plenty of which being whitiſh and well
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153522:43"/>concocted is often found in them in diſſection. Hence we may conclude that there is no third thing proceeding from the commixtion of male and female ſeed, which is fit for the generation of the Childe. But the Peripatericks in obedience to their grand Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſuppoſe that the ſeed of women is termed ſeed by analogy onely, and homonymie, concurring not to the generation of the <hi>fetus,</hi> but onely by provoking to coition, and uſeful to moiſten the ſides of the wombe; which aſſertion they ſeem to make impregnable, by the fortifications of ſtrong reaſons:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If a woman had prolifical ſeed, ſhe might generate without obliging man to a copulation; for ſhe would have the ſeed and menſtruous blood the only two neceſſaries to generation of the Childe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> One being by it ſelf cannot be the reſult of two actual beings, but onely accidentally aggregate. Therefore out of two ſeeds the <hi>fetus</hi> cannot be produced.</p>
                     <p>To which objections, and others of the ſame nature, <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Both ſeeds, as well of male as female, though they be prolifical, are not ſufficient by themſelves to generate the <hi>fetus,</hi> but a due commixtion of both is requiſite in the wombe, by which the delineation of the Embryo is perfected: And ſo out of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat beings proceeds not one being by it ſelf; but yet out of divers incompleat beings one compleat is produced, is an opinion ſubject to no abſurdity.</p>

                  <head type="sub">There is not onely a concurrence of the ſeed, but of the Menſtruous blood alſo to the generation of the <hi>fetus,</hi> which is another principle onely material, not efficient as ſeed.</head>
                  <p>THE Mothers blood harbours none, or very few ſpirits, therefore it hath no efficient virtue, but onely ſupplies matter, out of which all the carnous parts are compounded, as the ſpermatick of the ſeed. And this blood is called <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous,</hi> becauſe in well affected women, which are neither with childe, nor give ſuck, it flows out every moneth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the menſtruous blood is an excrement iſſuing from the laſt aliment of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts, which at certain times, and obſerved limitations, is in a ſmall quantity purged out of the wombe, for the generation and nutrition of the</hi> fetus.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that menſtruous blood is an excrement, and uſeful as to its ſubſtance, being converted into the parts of the <hi>fetus,</hi> and the nutrition of them. And this blood is uſually in women plentifully, becauſe of the weakneſs of their heat, which cannot digeſt all the blood made in the liver, as alſo becauſe of their ſoft and moiſt temper, which breeds plenty of humors: Hence it is, that that blood exceeding in quantity is returned into the bigger veins, from the fleſh now filled, and as it were ſatisfied, and by them is thruſt out by the veins of the wombe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The time for the expurgation of this blood is twofold, univerſal and particular.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The univerſal is from twelve or fourteen yeers of age to fifty or fifty five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:153522:43"/>
                  <p>Before the twelfth or fourteenth yeer the veſſels of women are narrow, and the heat almoſt extinct by the plenty of humors, cannot expel the reliques; and before that age great plenty of the blood is ſpent in the augmentation of the body. But after the twelfth or fourteenth yeer heat begins to move in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous luſtre, the veſſels are enlarged, the breaſts ſwell, the body by a pleaſant tickling is inſinuated into luſt, and the genitals are fenced with new down. But on the other ſide, after fifty or fifty five, the effluxions of menſtruous blood ceaſe, becauſe the heat being weakened is not able any more to generate ſuch plenty of blood as may leave ſome reliques; of which if there be any, it cannot commodiouſly drive them away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The particular time is limited by the ſpace of a moneth, and that by the ſpace of three or foure dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This evacuation of the menſtruous blood returns uſually every moneth, which all attribute to the motion of the Moon, Empereſs of the humors: and experience informs us, that this purgation is commonly contingent to the more youthful about a new Moon, but to the ancient about full Moon: This cauſed that common piece of Poetry,

                  <p>After the conformation of all the ſpermatick parts, they are bedewed with an influence from the menſtruous blood which over-flowes all their intermediate parts, from whence the formative virtue produceth all the carnous parts; which are then finiſhed when the <hi>fetus</hi> begins to move: for this is a ſign that the muſcles cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing motion are now perfect.</p>

                  <p>WHen the <hi>fetus</hi> hath arrived to its full conformation, nutrition and accretion in the wombe, not receiving ſufficient aliment, and being made vigorous by a greater heat, ſuch as for ventilation, wants the inſpiration of the air; it begins to thruſt for room, and by kicking forceth its way through thoſe membranes in which it lies invelop'd, and diſtends the wombe, which upon their irritation endeavours to rid it ſelf of this troubleſome burden; this cauſeth a double motion, one of the Childe, labouring its liberty, the other of the wombe, endevouring to enfranchiſe it. But the Parturition is <hi>natural,</hi> when the infant runs headlong, and turns this part firſt out of dores, but the reſt are preternatural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the times in which Parturition may happen are, the ſeventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh moneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We omit the eighth, becauſe the <hi>fetus</hi> doth perpetually in the ſeventh moneth beſtir it ſelf a little, and if it be ſtrong enough it breaks open dore, and out it goes; but if weaker, it remains ſtill priſoner, but ſo weakened with that foyl, that it wants the ſpace of two moneths to repair its ſtrength ſo broken. If therefore it break forth the ſeventh moneth, it is ſo ſpent by thoſe new ſtruglings, that death is the neceſſary conſequence thereof. Aſtrologers aſcribe the cauſe of this to the unhappy influence of <hi>Saturne,</hi> whom the eighth moneth they inveſt in chief autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; of which opinion, and others relating to the divers ſeaſons of Parturition, adviſe with <hi>Laurentius, Queſt.</hi> 19. <hi>Book</hi> 8. <hi>of his Anatomy.</hi>

                     <hi>Phyſicians divide ſimilitude into three parts; of the <hi>Species,</hi> of the <hi>Sex,</hi> of the <hi>Individuum.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Similitude of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is when the thing generated is of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> with the thing generating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO man generates a man, a dog a dog, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Similitude of the ſex is, when the thing begotten is of the ſame ſex with either parent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the male reſembles the father in regard of the ſex, but the female the mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that likeneſs of ſex depends on the predominating of the Maſculine or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine ſeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:153522:45"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> contends, that the ſeed falling from the right parts, either of male or female, is the ſtrongeſt and moſt apt for generation of males: Hence, if that maſculine ſeed flowing from the right be predominant, the iſſue will be male; but if the feminine bred in the left, be more plentiful, the iſſue will be female.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſimilitude of the</hi> individuum <hi>is, when the iſſue repreſents in the frame of his body ſome other</hi> individuum <hi>of the ſame ſpecies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Childe is ſtamp'd with the effigies ſometimes of his Father, ſometimes of his Mother, ſometimes his Grandfather, ſometimes of ſome other perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this ſimilitude depends not onely upon the formative vertue implanted on the ſeed, but ſometimes alſo on imagination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The formative virtue faſhioning all the parts of the body, and effigiating them into a form, which is implanted in the ſeed, with which it was ſigned by all the parts of the parents, it is neceſſarily conſequent, that as to its form it ſhould bear a ſimilitude to them; to the Father, upon the ſtrength of the paternal; to the Mother, upon the predominancy of the maternal ſeed. But becauſe ſome faculty of the Grandfathers, or Great-grandfathers, lyeth occult in the ſeed of the parents ſtamp'd on their parts, it happens ſometimes that this image is rubbed over in their poſterity, which is the cauſe of their aſſimilation between them, their Grand-fathers, or other alliances. Hence ſome are of opinion that this virtue lives to the fourth generation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the ſtrength of imagination is very prevalent in cauſing ſimilitude: For a woman, if in the time of conception ſhe ſettles her imagination on the effigies of ſome thing, brings forth a ſpawn of the like reſemblance. So a certain woman having the picture of an <hi>Aethiope</hi> in her chamber, brought forth an iſſue wholly black. So many pregnant women when they earneſtly long for ſomething, mark their iſſue with the effigies of it, for ſuch extravagancy of deſire diſturbs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and imprints on the ſpirits the ſhape of the thing ſo deſired, which ſpirits eaſily brand the tender infant with that mark.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>ATURE is twofold,</hi> according to the Philoſophers, univerſal, and particular. The laws of univerſal nature require genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, corruption, and various alteration, to be ſtrictly obſerved in bodies, which are therefore obedient to the dictates of this univerſal nature; but particular nature, <hi>viz.</hi> humane, hath enacted laws proper to the conſtitution of her own Republick, differing from the laws of univerſal nature, which if they be cancelled, a man is then thought to decline from nature, <hi>viz.</hi> particular nature. So a certain harmony of firſt qualities conſtitute Mans body, together with a due conformation and adunation of the parts; in which, when there happens any diſtraction, a body becomes preternatural, as ſhall be at large expounded in the following Treatiſe. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that ſome (in the front of whom marches <hi>Fernelius</hi>) diſtinguiſh things <hi>preternatural</hi> from thoſe which are <hi>contrary to nature;</hi> ſo that that is preternatural, which though it be illegal in its aberration from the rule of nature, yet it offers no violence to it, as pimples to the face, and the colour contracted from the heat of the Sun: But that is contrary to nature which violently oppoſeth it, and manifeſtly mutilates its actions. But theſe two are commonly confounded by Phyſicians, and uſed for one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſtate of mans body is threefold; healthy, unhealthy, and neutral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers diſavow this diviſion, and affirm, that there intercedes no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between diſeaſe and health: But the Phyſicians term that unhealthy, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous ſtate, when ſome actions of the body are manifeſtly out of tune; healthy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153522:46"/>when they perſiſt in a ſymmetry; but neutral, when they are neither manifeſtly vitiated, nor altogether whole; ſuch a diſpoſition is evidently apparent in thoſe which are in a tendency to, or in a recovery from a Diſeaſe; for it was neceſſary to induce theſe three conſtitutions into the Art of Medicine, for two cauſes chiefly: The <hi>firſt</hi> is drawn from Medical operations, and the manner of dyet to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every one; for cure is neceſſary for the ſick, conſervation for the healthy; but to bodies neuters, if they incline to diſeaſe, preſervation; to the recovery from a diſeaſe, refection or reſtauration. The <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſe is taken from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory dayes, which are not to be computed from the beginning of every weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of health, but from that time in which the ſick perſon hath ſuffered manifeſt and notable impediments in his actions, ſo that he is neceſſitated to reſt; which could not be ſo diſtinguiſhed, unleſs a neutrality of ſtate were diſtinguiſhed from inſalubrity. Yet the difference between Philoſophers and Phyſicians is not ſo wide that it abhors reconciliation; which may be made, if we ſay, That the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Diſcourſe of Diſeaſe and Health in a wider ſenſe, as alſo <hi>Galen</hi> ſometimes takes them, ſo that in this latitude they comprehend the ſtate of neutrality: The Phyſicians cloſe nearer, and uſe them more ſtrictly, as the uſe of Art requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. For the more copious explication of theſe three ſtates, I referre you to Galen <hi>in his Ars Parva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We muſt now by courſe treat of the ſtate of inſalubrity, by which means are three conſiderations:</hi> 1 <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> 2 <hi>The Cauſe of the Diſeaſe.</hi> 3 <hi>The Symptomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that Treatiſe diſcourſeth of that diſpoſition of the body which is termed Diſeaſe. For, that we may attain a perfect knowledge of it, the firſt propoſition muſt be of its nature, then we muſt make a ſearch into all its differences, next the cauſes which produce thoſe Diſeaſes are to be enquired into; and laſtly, the effects produced by them will require our contemplation, for the effects of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes the Phyſicians call Symptomes. By this means all Pathology is commonly divided into three <hi>Sections;</hi> in the firſt of which, the nature of the Diſeaſe, and its differences; in the ſecond, the cauſes of Diſeaſes; in the third, the ſymptomes of Diſeaſes, are by explication made obvious. But becauſe the conſideration of the Criſis is not any where ſo appoſitely placed, as in Pathology, being defined by a mutation made in the Diſeaſe, therefore we have reſolved to adde to our Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy a <hi>fourth</hi> Section, comprehending the whole doctrine of the Criſis, and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical dayes, and this we will advance to the ſecond place: So that the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall handle the nature and differences of a Diſeaſe; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the changes contingent in Diſeaſes, of which the chief is the Criſis; the <hi>third,</hi> the cauſes of Diſeaſes; and the <hi>fourth,</hi> the ſymptomes.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A Diſeaſe is a diſpoſition of a body preternatural, primarily and by it ſelf injuring the actions.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GALEN in his firſt Book of the Method of Healing, and in his Book of the Differences of Diſeaſes,</hi> in a well-contrived and clear method, hath omitted nothing diſcoverable in the nature of a Diſeaſe, whom in this place we propoſe for our pattern. Firſt then, we deliberate of action it ſelf, which if it be hurt in mans body, we ſay it is ſick; but if whole, and unhurt, we ſay it is in health. I call that action hurt, which manifeſtly and ſenſibly appeareth ſuch; for ſmall harms, and imperceptible by the ſenſe, are excluded from this place. Moreover, action being a motion, and having no permanent eſſence, onely ſo long in being as it is doing and performing; therefore it implies a neceſſity of a conſtant and permanent cauſe: But this cauſe is a corporeal inſtrument, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth the action, as the Eye ſeeth, the Stomach concocteth. But becauſe one and the ſame inſtrument doth not alwayes exerciſe in the ſame manner its operations, but ſometimes unhurt, and according to nature, ſometimes hurt, and beſide nature, it will neceſſarily follow that the conſtitution and diſpoſition thereof is various: Hence, if it be diſpoſed according to nature, the body will alſo be naturally diſpoſed, and exerciſe actions conformable to nature: If therefore the body be in health, when being naturally diſpoſed, it produceth perfect actions; it will be diſeaſed, when it being diſpoſed beſide nature, it exerts actions imperfect, and ſo this detriment of actions will depend upon this preternatural diſpoſition. This definition therefore perfectly opens the intricacie of a Diſeaſe, and is compleat, bearing in his bulk a genus, a ſubject, a cauſe, and an effect; the genus is the diſpoſition, which being not circumſcribed by the limits of any difference, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated not onely of a Diſeaſe, cauſe of Diſeaſe, and ſymptomes thereof, but of health alſo; the ſubject is mans body; the cauſe effecting the Diſeaſe is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of the ſymmetry of the parts, or an exceſs overflowing the proper and natural conſtitution, which by that terme [Preternatural] is demonſtrated. Laſtly, the immediate effect of a Diſeaſe is an ingredient alſo of the definition, which is the detriment of actions, which perpetually attending the Diſeaſe, and being obvious to our ſenſes, diſcovers the ſecrecie of it, deceiving otherwiſe the quickeſt glance of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>This definition being laid as a foundation, the ſuperſtructed theorems will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the nature of a Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſe is placed in the predicament of quality, and the firſt ſpecies thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:153522:47"/>
                  <p>The firſt ſpecies of quality is habit and diſpoſition; for though we called Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe by the name of diſpoſition, which is a flitting quality, and eaſily deſerting the ſubject, according to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> yet here we ſtretch it to adequate a little wider ſenſe, that it may comprehend habit alſo, and ſo that whole firſt ſpecies of quality.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may <hi>object,</hi> That Diſeaſe ſhould be placed in divers predicaments: for magnitude increaſed ſeems to be aptly referred to quantity, the ſtone and maw-wormes to ſubſtance, and ſo of the reſt; but all theſe <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf calleth Diſeaſes. To this <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That all diſeaſes are formally placed in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of quality, but may fundamentally be reduced to others, as by thoſe nearer cauſes, which are contained under other predicaments (of which ſort are the ſtone, maw-worms, magnitude increaſed, number exceeding or deficient, and ſuch like, which are as it were the foundations of diſeaſes) a certain diſpoſition is introduced, conſtituting the true form of diſeaſe, but the predicament only reſpects the form.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe things which are placed under other predicaments, as the ſtone, maw-worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by <hi>Galen</hi> and others, for perſpicuity ſake, called diſeaſes, as alſo for the inſufficiency of names, by which thoſe diſpoſitions may be ſignified: and becauſe it was ſatisfactory to the Phyſician intending curation to underſtand the nature of that thing, which being taken away the whole preternatural diſpoſition and detriment of the functions would be taken away alſo, not that to the accurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Philoſophical inſpection they would appear true diſeaſes, but rather cauſes, which often accompany us, without any evident hurt of the functions; and the ſtone, maw-worms, and the like, cannot injure us before they be abetted ſome by diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our bodies as obſtuctrion, or divulſion.</p>
                  <p>It may again be <hi>objected,</hi> That the fit place for diſeaſe is in the predicament of relation, which is gathered out of <hi>Galens</hi> words in the <hi>beginning of his book of the difference of diſeaſes,</hi> where he ſaith, That health is a kind of ſymmetry, diſeaſe an ametry, but ſymmetry and ametry ſpeak nothing but relation, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſeems evidently to confirm, 7. <hi>of his Phyſicks Chap.</hi> 3. where he teacheth that diſeaſe and health are relations. To that <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That though diſeaſe be termed ametry or immoderateneſs, this proves it not to be a relation; for as deformity is a kind of diſproportion of the parts, yet handſomneſs and deformity are true qualities: So Diſeaſe is a diſproportion of the heat, cold, moiſture, or dryneſs, or of the parts; yet it is no relation, but a certain quality or diſpoſition, by means of which the whole body is diſaffected. Yet if a confeſſion muſt be extorted, that there is found in Diſeaſes ſome relation, that we may pay due obedience to the dictates of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> we ſay, that this is cauſed, as thoſe qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> health and diſeaſe, are mutually compared, according to their acceſs to, or receſs from medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity; ſuch a relation is found between extreme colours, and between virtue and vice, which no man will aſſert to be ſimple relations, which may be accidental to ſubjects, without any mutation of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every diſeaſe hath a permanence in the part, and permanence is of the eſſence of diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diſeaſe is defined by a Diatheſis or diſpoſition, which term ſignifies to us a certain poſition of its eſſence or parts, or conſtancy in the body, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from a ſimple affection, called a patible quality, and is the third ſpecies of quality. And this conſtancy is called permanency, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſpoſition ſo ſtamp'd upon the part, that its eſſence is different and ſeparate from the cauſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, an independent on it: and thoſe things which have a permanency, are by Phyſicians termed things made, or in fact, but thoſe which have no permanency <hi>eſſe in fieri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:153522:47"/>
                  <p>But it may be <hi>objected,</hi> That an ephemeral feaver, and other ſlighter affects, and ſome alſo more dangerous, as the epilepſie and apoplexy, have but a ſmall duration of time in the body, and ſo they may ſeem to have no permanency. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Permanency looks to two relations, either <hi>to time,</hi> which ſignifies du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo it is not of the eſſence of diſeaſe, becauſe the duration of many diſeaſes is but ſhort; or it may be referred <hi>to the exiſtence</hi> fix'd and ſtable, which ſignifies a certain poſition of the eſſence and parts which all diſeaſes have in the body, though the time of ſome be ſoon determined. Again, it is <hi>objected,</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are by conſent in a poſſibility, and owe their exiſtence to the communication of ſimple humors or vapors, which ceaſing, they alſo ceaſe: But theſe are by <hi>Galen</hi> numbred amongſt true diſeaſes, therefore all diſeaſes have not a permanence. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That diſeaſes by conſent cannot laſt long, but that it will follow that from their cauſes an idiopathy ſhould be introduced in the part; which though it be ſmall, hath alwayes ſomething of the fact ſufficient to conſtitute a true diſeaſe: But if the ſympathicall affect be yet ſo ſmall, that it hath no conſiſtency in the part, nor requires any peculiar cure, but dies by the taking away of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary diſeaſe, then <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe excludes it from the true nature of a Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>It is again <hi>objected,</hi> That diſeaſes by the general ſuffrages of all Phyſicians, have four times which are in a perpetual flux, <hi>viz.</hi> beginning, augmentation, ſtate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: Diſeaſes therefore being continually in motion, can have no permanency. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> The ages and times of diſeaſes reſpect their motion and various conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, but not their generation and eſſence, which perſiſts fix'd and conſtant; as the nature of man is preſerved in the ſame ſtate, though in him variety of ages toules on variety of change; ſo diſeaſes now made, and generated, run on their time, in which they are variouſly affected.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſome <hi>argue</hi> thus, To have permanency, and to be in fact, falls under the ſame underſtanding with Phyſicians, as is before intimated: But of all Feavers the Hectick onely is in fact, for this condition affords it a diſtinction from the reſt, which are ſaid to be onely in a tendency: Therefore the other Feavers have no permanency. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> In all diſeaſes there is ſomething which makes them ſuch, from which they produce their generation; but the morbifick cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the putrid humor, perpetually acteth in feavers, and multiplyeth that morbous quality, therefore they are ſaid to be in a poſſibility, till they arrive to an Hectick, <hi>viz.</hi> when the cauſe reſts from action, by reaſon of an equal intemperateneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and then they are ſimply called <hi>in fact;</hi> but the reſt partly <hi>in fact,</hi> partly in a poſſible tendency thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The neceſſary conſequence of every diſeaſe is action by it ſelf, and immediately hurt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes are not ſeldome occult from the ſenſes, yet all of them are underſtood by ſymptomes, which are their effects, and moſt of all by labefacted action, which immediately and by it ſelf depends upon diſeaſe, and ſo eſſentially, that if we aſſert action hurt, we neceſſarily imply a diſeaſe, on which it hath depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>But it may be <hi>objected,</hi> That action is often hurt immediately, by the very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick cauſes; for aliment too copiouſly burdenſome to the ventricle is hurtful to concoction, without the interpoſing of a diſeaſe: Therefore all action hurt depends noton a diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That the coction of the ventricle is not therefore hurt, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not concoct a great plenty of aliment; for it being requiſite that there ſhould be a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153522:48"/>certain proportion between the Agent and Patient, for the right exerciſe of action, if the Aliment be too copious, or of quality troubleſome, the action of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle is not hurt, though it cannot maſter it, as it is not troubled, though it cannot concoct Iron. This defect therefore depends on the diſproportion of the object.</p>
                  <p>It is again thus <hi>objected,</hi> Some ſymptomes may primarily and by themſelves hurt action, as the quality changed in the eye, <hi>viz.</hi> the yellow colour of the <hi>cornea tunica</hi> of men troubled with the Jaundies, cauſed by the effuſion of yellow choler into it, which immediately produceth ſight; for they can diſcern no colour but their own; but no diſeaſe can be impeached of ſuch treaſon againſt the eye. Therefore that colour which is the ſymptome, doth immediately injure action. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> in the eye peculiarly a preternatural colour may be termed a diſeaſe, for the eye in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution, ought to be without any colour, that it may be the fitter for the reception of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of external objects pure and inconfuſed, and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours: for that colour of the eye may be referred to diſeaſes in number, becauſe the number of qualities, which ought naturally to be in the eye, is increaſed. The ſame may be held of an extraneous taſte in the tongue, and ſound in the eare, which are impediments to the due perception of taſte, and ſound; hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in theſe peculiar inſtruments of ſenſe, peculiarly conſtituted, we may admit a peculiar kind of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Here ariſeth laſtly cauſe of <hi>objection,</hi> That in Sympathetick affects the actions of the parts are hurt without the violence of any diſeaſe, for if a diſeaſe were in the ſympathizing parts, we ſhould endeavour remedy for the which is not done, neither when the action of the nerves is hurt by the obſtruction of the brain, can we impute a diſeaſe to the nerves, but only to the brain. <hi>I oppoſe</hi> to this, That Therapeutick Phyſicians number not the ſympathetical affects with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, becauſe we apply no remedies to them; but if we conſider more ſeriouſly, we ſhall find they may be referred to ſome <hi>genus</hi> of diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the influence of animal ſpirits into the nerves is block'd up by the obſtruction of the brain, by the defect of which, motion and ſenſe decay: but this defect may be reckoned among diſeaſes, in the number of deficients, and ſo we may hold of many others.</p>

                     <hi>The Eſſential are taken from the very eſſence of the diſeaſe, and are otherwiſe called ſpecifical, becauſe out of them the</hi> genus <hi>and</hi> ſpecies <hi>are conſtituted: But they are three,</hi> viz. <hi>ſimilar, organical, and common.</hi>

                  <p>The whole eſſence of accidents depends upon ſubjects, therefore their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial differences muſt be derived from the differences of their ſubjects; but the ſubjects of diſeaſes are the parts of our body, which are properly called ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> which cohere to the whole maſs, and partake of life in common: for although by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the parts be divided into <hi>the containing, the contained, and thoſe that cauſe motion;</hi> where by the containing, he underſtands the living parts deſigned for the exerciſe of actions; by the contained, the humors; by thoſe cauſing motion, the ſpirits: there the name of part is tentered to the wideſt ſenſe, for nor humors nor ſpirits can be the ſubjects of diſeaſes, nor do they communicate of life, but they are rather the cauſes of diſeaſes, when they are extravagant in quality or quantity.

                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">Every ſimilar diſeaſe is called Intemperancy.</head>
                  <p>THE ſimilar Parts are compoſed of Elements onely, and their actions are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the ſymmetry of the foure firſt qualities, and the allaying them to a due fixation of temper. For the ſimilar Parts, as ſimilar, are voyd of any action, nutrition excepted, by reaſon of which they retaine convenient aliment when it is attracted, concoct it, and thruſt out ſuperfluities, all which are in them performed by the temper alone. As long therefore as a due temper is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſimilar parts, they regulate themſelves according to nature: But when they are intemperate, they are in a morbous condition, and ſo every diſeaſe affecting the ſimilar parts, will be intemperateneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But intemperateneſs breaks out into other differences, of which ſome are eſſential, ſome accidental.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, the Eſſential are ſome ſimple, ſome compound; the ſimple are foure;</hi> 1 <hi>Hot,</hi> 2 <hi>Cold,</hi> 3 <hi>Moiſt,</hi> 4 <hi>Dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Compound are the ſame in number;</hi> 1 <hi>Hot and moiſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Hot and dry,</hi> 3 <hi>Cold and moiſt,</hi> 4 <hi>Cold and dry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe intemperatures are called morbous, when they ſwell to ſuch an exceſs, that they do manifeſtly hurt the actions, otherwiſe they confine themſelves to the preſcripts of health; for inſtance, though a man of a bilious temper be hotter and dryer than is convenient for the moderation of a fit temperament, yet as long as in the exerciſe of his actions he is not irregular as to the preſcript of his innate temperament, he is not ſaid intemperate to diſeaſe, till tranſgreſſing the proper limitation of health, he falls, for example, into a feaver, or ſome other hot affect.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:153522:49"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The accidental differences of intemperateneſs are taken from the cauſe, or from the ſubject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we have omitted the Treatiſe of the accidental differences of diſeaſes, till we put an end to this Section, yet becauſe they do properly belong to intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs alone, therefore it will not be inconvenient to bring them upon this ſtage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect of the cauſe one intemperateneſs is called Material, the other Immaterial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Material intemperateneſs is that, which comes in the company of an internal cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Humor, Vapor, or Wind, as it happens in humoural Feavers, inflammations of the parts, and infinite others, and that <hi>Galen</hi> is termed intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs with the affluxion of humors; but the immaterial which is alſo called a naked intemperateneſs, is that which is produced by an exterior cauſe, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring help of the interior. This is not ſo frequent as the other, and very ſeldome happens, yet it may be found in a Maraſmus, a great refrigeration of the parts being contracted in cold water, or by a very cold Northwind, or in the Head-Ach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by violent heat, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect of the ſubject, one intemperateneſs is in the Habit, another in the Habitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Intemperateneſs which is in Habit, or which hath contracted habit, and is thereby confirmed, is alſo called <hi>Hectick,</hi> which doth ſo firmly inhere, that it is indeleble, it is alſo ſaid to be wholly conſummate; of this kind are the Hectick Feaver, and the leproſy; but that which is in habitude, or diſpoſition, is onely <hi>inchoate</hi> and ſtill in its primordiums, or at leaſt part produced, part unproduced, and eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble, as vulgar Feavers, and other diſeaſes without difficulty curable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect alſo of the ſubject, one intemperateneſs is Equal, the other Unequal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Equal</hi> intemperateneſs is that, which is equally diffuſed into all the parts of our body; ſo an hectick Feaver is an equal intemperateneſs, becauſe all the parts are over-heated in the ſame degree. But Unequal intemperateneſs is that which is not equally diſtributed to the parts of our body, ſo we call putrid Feavers une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſeaſes, becauſe in them the ſolid parts are not plainly heated, as the humors which heat hath wholly penetrated; ſo the feavers termed <hi>Epiala</hi> and <hi>Lypiria</hi> are called unequal intemperatures, becauſe in the <hi>Epiala,</hi> heat and cold are together felt all the body over, but in the <hi>Lypiria,</hi> the exteriors are ſtiffe with cold, the interiors parched with heat.</p>

                     <head>A COROLLARY, <hi>Concerning Similar Diſeaſes.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>It is <hi>in the front</hi> objected, that there is no poſſibility of a ſimple intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it would be either joyned with the matter, or ſtand apart from the matter; it is not with the matter, becauſe ſuch intemperateneſs depends upon ſome humor, but every humor is doubly qualified; but the immaterial proceeds from external cauſes; and they are the elements, every of which hath two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or mixt bodies, which have alſo two qualities by the predominant element. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That upon a due contemperation of qualities, the exceſs muſt be in one onely, when there are two cauſes internal and external joyned, which agree in one quality, are contrary in another; as when a diſeaſe is generated from blood and choler, the dryneſſe of the choler is tempered by the moiſtneſs of the blood,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153522:49"/>and there is no exceſſe, but both joyning the forces of their heat, effect an hot intemperateneſſe, the ſame is plain in external cauſes; for if the air be temperate to an hot and moiſt temper, and the aliments be cold, and moiſt, the coldneſſe of them, with the heat of the other, will cauſe contemperation, but the moiſtneſs of both will produce a moiſt intemperateneſſe. It is again <hi>objected,</hi> that there is no ſuch thing as a hot and moiſt intemperateneſſe, becauſe heat and moiſture are the principles of our life, and ſo they cannot be in conjunction diſeaſed. Again, that heat muſt be very intenſe, that it arrive to morboſity, but intenſe heat doth powerfully prey upon moiſture, and ſoon ſummons in its mate ſiccity, and ſo a hot and moiſt intemperateneſſe cannot together ſubſiſt: ſo we may ſay of cold intemperateneſſe, which generating great crudities, brings humidity plentifully into the body; hence it ſeems inconſiſtent with ſiccity. To theſe <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That heat and moiſture are convenient for the principles of our life, yet if they do ſo far tranſgreſſe, that the humors ſhaking off their allegiance to nature, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ventilation, do neceſſarily putrifie, which uſhers in preternatural heat, and that meeting with plenty of moiſture, cauſeth a hot and moiſt intemperateneſſe. Beſides, exceſſe of heat conſumes indeed humidity, but not ſo nimbly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſpace of time is ſufficient for the generation of moſt violent diſeaſes; as appears in bloody feavers, in which at the beginning there is plenty of moiſture, but upon their permanence, they call in the auxiliaries of a dry intemperature. In the ſame manner, a cold and dry intemperateneſſe ſpends time before the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a moiſt, by crudities. And though the effluxions of the excrements be copious, yet the ſolid parts retain their dry intemperateneſſe, as is ſeen in old men. The propoſed differences of diſeaſes, and thoſe alone Antiquity with a general conſent imbraced, which have alſo found entertainment with almoſt all Neotericks, excepting <hi>Fernelius,</hi> and ſome ſiders with him: For <hi>Fernelius</hi> hath brought to light two new kinds of diſeaſes, one related to the matter, the other to the form, or the whole ſubſtance. For, ſaith he, three things being conſidered in the ſimilar parts, matter, form, and temperament, the natural conſtitution of them being health, ſo the immoderateneſſe of every of them will be diſeaſe. And hence reſult three differences of diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> intemperatures, by the exceſſe of the firſt qualities; the immoderateneſſe of the matter is, when a part becomes ſofter or harder, looſer or cloſer, thinner or more craſſe, rarer or denſer; and the vitiating of the form is, when either by manifeſt diſeaſes, as by putrefaction; or by occult, as poyſonous, contagious, and peſtilent, the whole ſymmetry of the body is diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>Fernelius <hi>in his</hi> 1. <hi>Book of his Pathology, chap.</hi> 7. hath onely propoſed this his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet hath ſtrengthened it by a long diſputation <hi>in his</hi> 2. <hi>of the hidden cauſes of things, chap.</hi> 9. which becauſe it is famous, being born up by the authority of ſo learned a man, and hath wrack'd the wits of many, we will therefore enter the liſts in a ſhort diſpute with him. The reaſons then by <hi>Fernelius</hi> alleaged to confirm his opinion, may be comprehended in the following diſcourſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Diſeaſes uſually poſſeſſe thoſe by which the actions are performed: But there are three things in a ſimilar part, which execute the actions thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> matter, forme, and temperament, therefore this will be the place of Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſame is confirmed by the various detriment of actions in one and the ſame part; for the ventricle, as a ſimilar part, is often infirm, by which the concoction is weakened: but this infirmity is ſometimes cauſed by immoderate refrigerations, as by over much drinking of water, eating of lettice, and the like;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153522:50"/>ſometimes by relaxation, as by taking in hot oyle, and the like; and laſtly, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and poyſonous qualities, which invade the ſtrength of its form. Therefore there muſt be three diſtinct kinds of diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this ſeems to be convincible from the remedies themſelves: For there are three kinds of remedies of <hi>Galen</hi>'s own conſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome which alter only in the firſt qualities; and theſe are applicable to the intemperateneſſe in diſeaſes: but ſome, whoſe affects are aſtriction, relaxation, attenuation, incraſſation, and theſe heal diſeaſes in the matter: Laſtly, ſome there are whoſe action proceeds from their whole ſubſtance, and an occult propriety, and theſe are uſed to cure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the whole ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in a Gangrene, Leproſie, and malignant ulcers, the whole ſubſtance of the parts is corrupted: Therefore that there are diſeaſes of the whole ſubſtance is undeniable.</p>
                     <p>But in our judgement thoſe reaſons are not ſo weighty, or of validity enough to force us to a multiplication of the anciently confirmed differences of ſimilar diſeaſes. We ſay therefore, that this opinion of <hi>Fernelius</hi> is not to be entertained, and before we anſwer the objections brought, we will confute it as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Diſeaſe is an affection of the whole ſimilar part, as ſuch: Therefore the matter and form cannot be ſaid to be diſeaſed, but the whole frame; for intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature alone is the proper affection of the whole ſimilar part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> All action of the ſimilar part is natural: but all natural actions are only foure, attraction, retention, concoction, and expulſion, which depend upon the temper only. Therefore there will be but one diſeaſe of a ſimilar part, <hi>viz.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperateneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All diſeaſes have the force of action, <hi>viz.</hi> the action of hurting. But in the matter there is no action, for it is a paſſive and potential principle, therefore there is no diſeaſe of the matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If there were a diſeaſe of the form, the definition of a diſeaſe given with the conſent as well of all the ancients, as Neotericks, would be erroneous, which they aſſert to be a diſpoſition of the body: But the form is incorporeal: Therefore not ſubject to diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If there were diſeaſes of the form, infinite abſurdities would follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that the form may ſuffer by it ſelf, may be generated and corrupted, may be increaſed and diminiſhed, may have a contrary, all which Philoſophy abhors as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If the corruption of the form, or the whole ſubſtance, be a diſeaſe, it muſt be conſidered, either in its end, and abſolute, or in a tendency, and not yet conſummate. If abſolute, it is nothing elſe but the abolition and total deſtruction of the creature: If not yet perfect, but in motion to it, it will be an alteration, onely preparing way for corruption, and ſo a quality conſtituted in intemperateneſs. And ſo this opinion of <hi>Fernelius</hi> is convincingly refuted. To the <hi>reaſons</hi> brought to fortifie it, we give this <hi>anſwer.</hi> To the <hi>firſt</hi> we ſay, That the concurrence of matter and form is not requiſite for the perfection of actions, but onely for the conſtitution of the <hi>compoſitum,</hi> for actions proceed from the compoſed, not the compoſing, but the <hi>compoſitum</hi> operates according to the diſpoſition found in it: And this diſpoſition in a ſimilar part, is the temper only.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>ſecond, I anſwer,</hi> That the action of the ventricle is not purely ſimilar, but proceeds partly from the temper, partly from the conformation and ſtructure of it, for the alteration and coction of the aliments cannot rightly be performed, unleſs they be duely contained and incloſed by the ventricle: But this retention, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:153522:50"/>coarctation depends upon the ventricle, formed in this or that manner. As often therefore as the ventricle is refrigerated, ſo that it cannot concoct, there is an intemperateneſs, or a ſimilar diſeaſe; but when it is ſo relaxed, that it cannot contain, there is an organical diſeaſe: Laſtly, when the action of the ventricle is infirmed by venemous things, there is ſome intemperateneſſe, becauſe the implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted temperament of that part is corrupted, and that intemperateneſſe is called ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, or venemous, as ſhall after be ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the third I anſwer,</hi> That thoſe ſecond qualities do immediately depend upon the firſt: ſo adſtrictives are cold and dry, relaxatives hot and moiſt, and ſo forth: But thoſe which operate from the whole ſubſtance, perform it by occult qualities, which are referred to the temper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the laſt I anſwer,</hi> That intemperateneſſe is twofold, one vulgar, the other malignant; as ſhall be ſhewed in the Accidental differences; but the propoſed affections may eaſily be referred to malignant intemperateneſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Diſeaſe in aſperity and levity is, when the parts which are naturally of a rough or rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged impoliteneſs, become ſmoother; or on the other ſide the ſmoother become rougher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For inſtance, when the ventricle and inteſtines being burthened with mucous flegme are troubled with <hi>Lienteria,</hi> this diſeaſe is in levity; but when the <hi>Aſperd arteria</hi> being exaſperated by diſtillation from the brain, contracts hoarſeneſſe, the diſeaſe lies in aſperity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſe in the paſſage and cavity, is when the natural conſtitution of the paſſages and cavities is deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of this again there are three</hi> ſpecies; 1 <hi>Aſtriction,</hi> 2 <hi>Obſtruction,</hi> 3 <hi>Dilatation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtriction is cauſed when a paſſage or cavity is crouded up by an external cauſe, and becomes narrower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when the <hi>Aeſophagus,</hi> and the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> are preſſed by the Quinſie, and the bladder is forced together, by the burden of a great childe lock'd up in the wombe, that diſeaſe ariſeth which is called aſtriction.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:153522:51"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſtruction is produced, when ſome preternatural matter takes poſſeſſion of the internal cavities, and ſtops up the paſſages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the ſtone is bred in the bladder; when thick, viſcid, and clammy matter, blocking up the interiour veins of the liver, milt, and other parts, and the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of humors, and the like, cauſes an obſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dilatation proceeds from the amplitude and wideneſs of the cavities and paſſages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dilatation is contrary to aſtriction and obſtruction; we have an example of it in the dilating the ball of the eye, and in the crooked veins, as alſo in the anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis and diapedeſis of the veins. For an Anaſtomaſis is cauſed when the orifices of the veſſels are too much dilated; but diapedeſis, when their tunicles are too much relaxed and rarefied, that they eaſily yeeld to the effluxion of the humors. To dilatation alſo is referred the exceſſive laxity of the ventricle, ſo that it cannot conveniently embrace the Aliment, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> unadviſedly placed with the diſeaſes of the matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The diſeaſes of magnitude are either in the Augmentation, or diminution thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Both are either in the whole body, or in ſome part of it; in the whole body, magnitude is increaſed, or diminiſhed, when the whole bulk is to extremity encreaſed or diminiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> preſents us with an example of encreaſed magnitude in the whole body of one <hi>Nicomachus Smyrnaeus,</hi> who by reaſon of his exceſſive groſſeneſs could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly move himſelf. Diminiſhed magnitude is apparent in atrophy, and hectick Feaver, in which the whole body pines away with leaneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude is increaſed or diminiſhed in ſome part, when it exceeds, or recedes from the dimenſions allotted it by nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a preternatural tumor in a part is magnitude increaſed: ſo alſo the defect of a part in longitude, latitude, or profundity, as of the Tongue, Noſe, Finger, the teſticles, or a notable ſmalneſs of ſome other part, is diminiſhed magnitude. For the occaſion of this ſmalneſs, is either by generation for want of matter; or after generation, and that is again two-fold; by defect of Aliment, whence ariſeth the atrophy, and conſumption of the part, or the depriving the parts of their ſubſtance, as when a part of the noſe, tongue, or finger is cut off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes in number are, either in exceſſe, or in defect of Number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A definite number of the ſimilar parts is neceſſary to conſtitute the organical, and in the greater, and more compoſed, the concurrence of a certain number of leſſer organs and leſſe compoſed is requiſite. But by their exceſs any way, or defect, they cauſe diſeaſe, which is termed a diſeaſe of number increaſed, or diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Number exceeding is either of thoſe which are regulated by nature, or which are in the latitude of their</hi> genus <hi>preternatural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are ſaid to be according to nature, in reſpect of the ſubſtance from which they derive their original, which ſubſtance is natural, and they only erre in this that they conduce not to the exerciſing of the functions of the part; but hinder them, as a ſixth finger, an excreſcence of fleſh in an ulcer, and the like. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural as to their whole <hi>genus</hi> are thoſe, which are compoſed of a ſubſtance wholly preternatural, as maw-worms, the ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are referred to diſeaſes in number, as they are things of a preternatural ſuperaddition, vitiating the ſtructure of the organ, and by its preſence hindering the functions thereof; otherwiſe if they injure not the actions, but produce obſtruction, or the like affection, they are taken rather for the cauſes of diſeaſe, as we have before obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Number deficient, perpetually conſiſts in natural things, or in the parts of the body, contracted either from the womb it ſelf, or after the deſertion thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:153522:51"/>
                  <p>Diſeaſe in deficient number, contracted from the very birth, is ſo called, when, for inſtance, any one is born mutilated either in the Foot, Hand, Eye, Teſticle, or any other part; but after birth, upon the amputation of ſome part, as when the foot, or arm infected with a gangren is chop'd off, the teſticles are fallen by a rupture, a rotten tooth is pulled out, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes in conjunction are two-fold; in Situation and in Connexion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes in Situation are, when the parts which ought to cohere, fall off from their proper Station.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe diſeaſes are obvious in a rupture, when the inteſtines or the cauſe deſcends in the Scrotum, ſo in the falling of the Anus or the womb, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes in Connexion are, when the parts which ſhould cohere, ſtand at a diſtance, or on the contrary, thoſe which ſhould ſeparate, cohere.</hi>

                  <p>Such affections appear in luxations, when the connexion of the bones is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and in imperforate parts, as alſo when the eye lids, or the lips, are united, which ſhould naturally be ſeparated.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is firſt objected,</hi> That the number of organical diſeaſes before a laid down is incompleat, becauſe their differences are not taken from all thoſe things, which are neceſſary for the performance of organical actions. But beſides thoſe now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there are many others concurring: for the inſtrumentary parts, want the influence of heat from the heart, <hi>viz.</hi> blood and well affected ſpirits, whereas when they are hurt, or wanting, all the actions of the body are out of tune, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a ſyncope, trembling, ſtarkneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From them therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another <hi>ſpecies</hi> of organical diſeaſe. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> in the proper conſtitution of every part, the common inſtruments are to be diſtinguiſhed, which are neceſſary in all actions of the organick parts: for they are not peculiarly conſidered in either, but as vagrants, and wanderers are excluded from the number of the parts of the living body, or we may aſſert, that the affections iſſuing from the vitioſity of them are not idiopathetick, but ought only to be referred to the ſympathy of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, or faculty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is ſecondly objected,</hi> That beſides the aforeſaid conditions ingredient to the conſtitution of organical parts, there is a ſymmetry of them requiſite, for if the foot, or the hand, which ought to be conflated of bones, nerves, and ligaments, are wholly offeous, or camous, the ſtructure of them is bad, though they are rightly framed as before is ſaid. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> if an organical part which ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many inſtruments, be conflated but of one, this is a diſeaſe in the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number, nor need we make ſearch after another diverſe <hi>genus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is laſtly objected,</hi> That the actions of organical parts are offended, by the qualities themſelves, as well firſt as ſecond: for example, the harder, or ſofter, craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer or thinner parts, are made more unfit for ſenſe or motion, as <hi>Galen</hi> is of opinion, that the craſſity of the brain is very noxious to ſharpneſs of wit, but the tenuity thereof very commodious, ſo the laxity of the ventricle is inconvenient for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, the <hi>cornea tunica</hi> of the eye, being too rare, or too thick hinders ſight, and ſo of the reſt: hence it appears that theſe qualities alſo ought to be added to the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153522:52"/>number of organical diſeaſes. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That diſeaſes conſequent upon the change of qualities, cannot be attributed to the organical parts, as organical, but as they are compounded of the ſimilar parts, as their matter; for a due ſymmetry of the ſimilar parts muſt concur to the conſtitution of an inſtrumentary part; and the temperament of the ſimilars muſt be ſuppoſed to be as well in the firſt as in the ſecond qualities, therefore the diſproportion of them muſt not be laid to the charge of the organical part, though it injure the actions thereof, becauſe it is accidental; as an houſe falls, when the wood or ſtones are rotten, or corrupted, though they are not formally related to the houſe.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>anſwer</hi> may again be thus <hi>oppoſed,</hi> That there is as much reaſon, thoſe ſecond qualities, hardneſs, ſoftneſs, and the reſt, ſhould be referred to the diſeaſes of the organical parts, as aſperity, and laevity, which are alſo in the number of the ſecond qualities, and were by us reckoned amongſt the diſeaſes of conformation. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That the reaſon holds not the ſame; becauſe hardneſs, ſoftneſs, and the reſt, are not changed but upon the change of the temper it ſelf; but aſperity and laevity, which are affections of the ſuperficies only, do ſo depend upon the formative faculty, that without any diverſity of temper, it produceth ſome ſmooth and equal, ſome rough and unequal; as appears in bones, which are moſt dry, and yet of a very even ſuperficies, and in the ventricle, whoſe external ſuperficies is even the internal, rough and rugged: and ſo of the reſt.</p>

                     <hi>The Differences of the common Diſeaſe, or ſolution of the continuum, are taken from the cauſe, or the ſubject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The cauſes from which the ſolution of the continuum happens are four: to the firſt, things thin, and convenient for ſection are referred; to the ſecond things ſharp, and fit for Eroſion; to the third things heavy, hard, and dull, to the fourth things fit for ruption, and divulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſolution of the continuum which is cauſed by cutting things is called Section.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UNder this are comprehended all ſolutions of the continuum, produced by the inciſion of external cauſes, either with point, or edge in any part of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſolution of the continuum proceeding from things ſharp and eroding, is termed Eroſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eroſion is moſt uſually produced in the parts of the body by internal cauſes, as by ſharp and biting juyces cauſing ulcers, it is produced alſo ſometimes by external application, or things actually burning, as by fire, hot iron; or poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as cauſtick medicines, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſolution of the continuum cauſed by things heavy, hard, and dull, is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſolution of the continuum, is not uſually manifeſt, but hidden: for in it the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153522:52"/>parts are daſhed together, and violently preſſed, which compreſſion cauſeth an occult ſolution of the <hi>continuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſolution of the</hi> continuum <hi>proceeding from things breaking and divulſive, is called ruption or divulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is often ſeen in torture, in which the toes and the fingers are ſo diſtracted that they are quite ſeparated from the other parts; ſo by over-reaching the <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> is uſually burſt, which is the cauſe of a rupture. Sometimes alſo by an over-repletion of blood the tunicles of the veins are divuls'd, whence flows an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate flux of blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect of the ſubject, or the parts of our body, divers differences of the ſolution of the</hi> continuum <hi>are conſtituted, and divers names are impoſed on them. For inciſion made in the fleſh is called a wound, but croſion an ulcer. A tranſverſe inciſion made in the bone is a fracture, a direct a fiſſure, but eroſion is called putrefaction. A tranſverſe inciſion made in the veins, arteries, nerves and griſtles, retains the ſame name of inciſion, and a direct of a fiſſure. The</hi> ſpecies <hi>of peculiar ſolution is puncture, chiefly attributed to the nerves, but rupture to the membranes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all Chirurgical authors, thoſe differences of ſolution are contained under the term of Wounds, Ulcers, and Luxations.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Accidental differences of diſeaſes are thoſe which conſtitute not the <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies</hi> of diſeaſes, but only clear the way to the underſtanding of ſome of their proprieties.</head>
                  <p>THE Accidental differences propoſed by Authors are almoſt infinite, of all which it would be too tedious to inſtitute a Diſcourſe, and perhaps in our judgement of ſmall uſe. We ſhall therefore ſerve thoſe to you here which are more requiſite to the uſe of Art, and more frequently occurre in the Treatiſe of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they are derived either from the eſſence of diſeaſes or proprieties attending it, or from the cauſes of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eſſential differences of a diſeaſe flow from the very eſſence thereof, as was before declared; but the accidental differences ſpring from ſome proprieties aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating with the eſſence of the diſeaſe, as alſo from the cauſes and effects. But we will here offer thoſe onely which proceed from the eſſence and cauſes, omitting the reſt, as in themſelves common to vulgar capacities, and of little uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The proprieties which are companions of the eſſence of diſeaſes, are firſt, Magnitude; ſecondly, Motion; thirdly, the manner; fourthly, the event.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of magnitude, a diſeaſe is ſaid to be great or little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That diſeaſe is great, which is very intenſe, and is very prevalent in the perturbation of our body. But that is termed little, which deviates but a little from the natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and induces but a ſmall infirmity on us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> affirms that a diſeaſe is called great for three reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in reſpect of the part, if it affects a principal part, or one neceſſary to the conſervation of life: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of the cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> if they be very violent and furious: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in reſpect of the ſymptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> if the body being ſtormed by this fierceneſs and violence, be much oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of motion, there are foure times of diſeaſes conſiderable, the beginning, increaſe, ſtate and declination. The beginning of a diſeaſe is when it is conſtant to the ſame diſtemper with which it was at firſt produced, without any notable acceſs of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Increaſe is when the diſeaſe is ſenſibly ſeen to increaſe. State is, when the diſeaſe is beyond augmentation, and reſerves the ſame violence, which was left at the higheſt pitch of augmentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:153522:53"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, declination is when the violence of a diſeaſe is evidently broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diviſion of the times of diſeaſes, is by <hi>Galen</hi> not drawn onely from the eſſence of the diſeaſe it ſelf, but alſo from the cauſes, and ſymptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> when from the beginning they increaſe to higher inflammations, till they arrive to a ſtate, and in declination are mitigated; and chiefly from the excrements, which are at firſt a very crudity, in increaſe preſent a kind of a rudiment of coction, in their ſtate give ſtrong evidences of coction, and in their declination ſhew abſolute concoction, and a change of excrements into better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the times of diſeaſes are univerſal or particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The univerſal times are parts of the whole diſeaſe, conſidered from the beginning to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the particular times are the parts of paroxiſmes, apparent in intermiſſive diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the paroxiſmes of every diſeaſe have beginning, augmentation, and declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the whole diſeaſe conſidered in its whole flux of time.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that all diſeaſes have not foure times, but onely healthy ones, for deadly alwayes kill before declination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In motion the quantity and manner are conſiderable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect of the quantity of motion, or duration, one diſeaſe is called long, another ſhort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a day-expiring feaver is a ſhort diſeaſe, becauſe it is quickly at an end; as dropſie long, becauſe it perſiſts a long time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect alſo of the quantity of motion or duration, one diſeaſe is called acute, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chronical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acute diſeaſe is that in which magnitude and brevity are companions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it moves nimbly with vehemence and danger. The Chronical is commonly oppoſed to this, though it be not totally contrary to it: For Chronical and Long ſpeak the ſame, and it is ſo called, only becauſe it is of long continuance, although it be uſually great, as the palſie, dropſie, and the like, to which the ſhort ones are truely and properly oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That ſome diſeaſes are in reſpect of their proper eſſence Chronical, in reſpect of their paroxiſme Acute, as the Epilepſie, which is a diſeaſe very long, and hath paroxiſmes very acute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acute diſeaſe is threefold; the firſt peracute, the ſecond acute ſimply, the third acute by dilapſion or decidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Peracute is again divided into extremely peracute and ſimply peracute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Extremely peracute is that which is ſo vehement and ſwift in motion, that the third or fourth day it ends either in health or in death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simply peracute, determines the ſeventh day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But acute ſimply ſo called, is either exactly, or not exactly ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exactly ſuch ends with the fourteenth day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not exactly ſuch continueth to the twentieth, or further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, acute by decidence reaches the fortieth day; and after its arrival to that, it is called a long and continuing diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And theſe are the differences hewn out from the quautity of motion: thoſe follow to be propoſed, which reſult from the manner of motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In reſpect then of the manner of motion, ſome diſeaſe is called continual, ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Continual diſeaſe is, which troubleth without ceſſation, and in its whole duration is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of mitigation, by any intervening pauſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But intermiſſive is that, the fury of which in its career, is uſually allayed by perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſo much of the Motion, now follows the manner of Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In reſpect of the Manner, a diſeaſe is called gentle, or malignant.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A gentle diſeaſe is that which is very remiſs, and induceth no dangerous ſymptomes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But that is malignant, which comes accompanied with ſome malignant and venemous quality, attended by dangerous ſymptomes.</hi>

                     <hi>Peſtilent diſeaſe is that which is malignantly and deleteriouſly qualified, and is impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to all.</hi>

                     <hi>So far of the Manner of diſeaſe, the Event thereof follows.</hi>

                     <hi>Healthy diſeaſe is that which threatens the life with no danger.</hi>

                     <hi>Deadly diſeaſe is that which brings along with it aſſured deſtruction.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And theſe are the differences proceeding from thoſe proprieties which are concomitants to eſſence; thoſe now which are derived from the cauſes, remain to be propoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thoſe cauſes are either material or efficients, or helps, without the advantage of which nothing could be produced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Material we refer the ſubject, to the Efficient the humors, to thoſe without the help of which nothing could be, the place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many other kinds of Cauſes which here we propoſe not, becauſe we have determined to ſpin the accidental differences of Diſeaſes out of theſe alone; as alſo neither to lay down all that may be pick'd out from them, but only the moſt uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the ſubject, ſome diſeaſe is called Idiopathetick, ſome Sympathetick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Idiopathetick is that which is primarily produced in the part by its cauſe, and hath in it a place of duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a Pleuriſie, Inflammation of the lungs, and <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> and others, are termed Idiopathetick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sympathetick is when the affect of one part idiopathetically diſeaſed, is communicated to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the affection is ſo communicated to this compaſſionate part, that upon the ablation of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Idiopathetick, the Sympathetick is alſo taken away; otherwiſe, if it ſhould remain by it ſelf, it would become Idiopathetick, and then Phyſicians term it <hi>Deuteropathetick,</hi> or ſecondary: But the primary is called <hi>Protopathetick,</hi> becauſe the affection owes its firſt production to that part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But a Sympathetick diſeaſe is uſually generated by five cauſes.</hi> Firſt, <hi>becauſe of vicinity.</hi> Secondly, <hi>becauſe of the ſociety of the genus.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>becauſe of the community of office.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>by reaſon of ſituation.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>by reaſon of connexion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe of vicinity the hand ſympathizeth with the arm, the bone with the neighbouring fleſh, the ventricle with the liver, the ribs with the lungs, the lungs with the heart, and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:153522:54"/>
                  <p>By reaſon of the ſociety of the <hi>genus,</hi> the nervous parts ſympathize with the nervous, and the carnous with the carnous, as being conſtituted under the ſame <hi>genus,</hi> and partaking of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>By community of office, the breaſts with the wombe, the bladder ſympathizes with the reins, becauſe they are deſigned to the ſame employment in the body.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of ſituation, the head is eaſily compaſſionative with the inferiour parts; as, the ventricle, liver, wombe, and the like; as being in a direct eminency to them, and ſo the vapors by them elevated, are with eaſe conveyed to its rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. So alſo the ventricle and lungs, eaſily ſympathize with the head, as lying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under it, and ſo eaſily entertaining the defluxions of humors ſtreaming from it.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of connexion, the nerves are compatible with the brain, the arteries with the heart, the veins with the liver, and on the contrary, as bordering upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, all ſympathetical diſeaſe is cauſed two wayes,</hi> viz. <hi>poſitively or privatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſitively, when any thing is conducted from one part to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the vapors ſteaming from the ventricle to the brain, produce aches, vertigoes, and ſuch like ſympathetical affections, which are termed poſitive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Privatively, when there is no influence where there ought to be one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the apoplexy, the ſenſe and motion of the whole body decayes, by the non-influence of the animal faculty and ſpirits from the brain, cauſed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the ventricles thereof. And ſo it is ſaid to proceed from the privation of matter or faculty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of the efficient cauſes, or the humors operating diſeaſes, ſome are called legitimate, ſome ſpurious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The legitimate is, which is graved with that impreſs of Nature, which is proper to its</hi> ſpecies, <hi>and the cauſe of whoſe uſual production is whole and ſincere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſpurious is that which neither retains its pure nature, nor hath a ſincere cauſe to which it may acknowledge its production.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A tertian feaver, excited by ſincere choler, is called true and legitimate, as alſo a quartan the effect of pure melancholy: But thoſe feavers are called baſtard, ſpurious, and illegitimate, when they have a confuſion of other humors befides thoſe now mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the place or region in which diſeaſes are generated, ſome are called endemical, ſome epidemical, ſome ſporadical.</p>
                  <p>Endemical diſeaſes are thoſe which are peculiar to ſome Region, and are in it commonly powerful.</p>
                  <p>They are otherwiſe called vernacular and gentilitious, becauſe they are alwayes appendent to one Region, by reaſon of the air, aliments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proper to that Countrey. So the Inhabitants of the <hi>Alpes</hi> are troubled with a <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are perplexed with ſtrumous ſwellings, the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> pine away with tabifical conſumptions, and all theſe are judged Endemical diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Epidemical diſeaſes are thoſe which in any Region rage among the popularity.</p>
                  <p>In this Endemical and Epidemical diſeaſes are neerly related, that they ſeiſe upon many, and ſpend their fury upon the popularity: But in this they differ, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical confine themſelves alwayes to the ſame Countrey, but Epidemical are indifferent, and inclinable to forain invaſions. The reaſon of which is this, becauſe Endemical proceed from the peculiar diſpoſition of the air, water, or dyet of the Countrey: but Epidemical are cauſed by the air alone, not infected by means of the place, but rather by the malignant influences of ſuperiour bodies.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:153522:54"/>
                  <p>The Sporadical are they which neither commonly range abroad, nor particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize themſelves to any Region.</p>
                  <p>They are alſo termed diſperſed, and are oppoſed to Endemical and Epidemical diſeaſes, becauſe they are various, and driven by contingences, do ſometimes light here, ſometimes there: So in this or any other Region, one is ſick of a pleuriſie, another languiſhing by a continual or tertian feaver, another troubled with a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhe, nephretical pains, gout, dropſie, or any diſeaſe of another nature, according to the various nature and conſtitution of individuals.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the nature and differences of diſeaſes, as well Eſſential as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental; now it reſts that we handle their Changes.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN Diſeaſes there are two mutations <hi>worth our notice,</hi> either when they meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſe into ſome other diſeaſe, or when they are abſolutely and ſimply diſſolved, without a tranſmigration into any other.</p>
                  <p>The change of one diſeaſe into another is frequently ſeen, when the Apoplexy makes a tranſition into a Palſie, a Tertian feaver into a Quartan; a quartan, the ſwelling of the liver or ſpleen, and many other affections turn their ſtream, and run into the channel of a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes are abſolutely and ſimply diſſolved, when without the interceſſion of any other diſeaſe they are determined either by health or death.</p>
                  <p>But their end in health or death is double:</p>
                  <p>To wit, leiſurely and by degrees, or ſuddenly and unawares.</p>
                  <p>When a diſeaſe is ſlowly and by little and little ended in death, it is called a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus; but when it is ſo ended in health, it is called ſimply Solution, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> termed <hi>Lyſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it is haſtily and ſuddenly ended, either by health or death, it is called <hi>Criſis,</hi> which is commonly oppoſed to <hi>Lyſis</hi> or ſolution, it being a frequent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with Authors, that all diſeaſes are terminated by <hi>Criſis</hi> or <hi>Lyſis.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">A Criſis is a ſudden and unexpected change happening in a diſeaſe, to health or to death.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HIppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> uſe this term <hi>Criſis</hi> many wayes; <hi>ſometimes</hi> they intend by <hi>Criſis</hi> nothing elſe but a ſecretion of humors, as <hi>Galen, Comment. on Aph.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. ſaith, That a <hi>Criſis</hi> is cauſed by Nature ſeparating the noxious humours from the good, and preparing them for excretion. But <hi>ſometimes</hi> by <hi>Criſis</hi> they ſignifie excretion it ſelf, becauſe the beſt <hi>Criſis</hi> is compleated by excretion. So <hi>Hippocrates in his Book of Art</hi> terms the excretion of a corrupt bone a <hi>Criſis;</hi> or <hi>laſtly,</hi> it is taken for a conflict, which upon the imminency of a <hi>Criſis</hi> is uſually waged between the diſeaſe and nature: But the more frequent and uſual acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of it is for judgement, which conſtruction hath been from <hi>Galen</hi>'s age to this, imbraced by many; for <hi>Galen in his Comment. on</hi> 1 <hi>Progn.</hi> witneſſeth that judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation paſſed on diſeaſes was derived from the Courts of Judicature, and applyed to the Art of Medicine, nor truly very improperly: for though the things from whence theſe tranſlations are taken, be not altogether like, yet the judgement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in diſeaſes hath ſome ſimilitude with forenſical judgement: For in Courts of Judicature, in capital cauſes, there is the perſon that brings the action, and the perſon guilty: The perſon that brings the action maintains a conflict with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guilty, and conſtantly accuſeth him, produceth witneſſes, and menaceth death or puniſhment: But if this accuſation be falſly charged upon the perſon ſeemingly guilty, he pleads boldly for himſelf, and retorts the puniſhment on him that brings the action; but if he cannot ſtand in contradictory oppoſition to the accuſation, he is forced to give up and yield. All theſe things are tranſacted before a Judge, who weighs them all, and at laſt on a certain time gives judgement of the whole matter. In the ſame manner in the <hi>Criſis</hi> the diſeaſe repreſents him that brings the action, nature the perſon guilty, the morbifick cauſe brings nature into the Court, endevouring to overthrow it; of this invaſion the ſymptomes are witneſſes, which declare the whole progreſs of the contention. But nature, which is as it were in the capacity of a guilty perſon, defends it ſelf ſtoutly againſt its adverſary diſeaſe, whoſe reſiſtance, if ſhe be well fortified, ſhe baffles, and turns him off as an unjuſt Plaintiff, and thruſts him out of Court; but if ſhe want good ſupports, ſhe muſt ſubmit to the fury of her Antagoniſt. All theſe things are points of accurate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to a Phyſician; who after a ſerious penſitation of the ſtrength of both parts, gives ſentence as a Judge, and deſignes that day of judgement in which either the diſeaſe or nature ſhall be caſt. From hence it is evident, that the compariſon of a <hi>Criſis</hi> with Judicature, is not wholly abſurd and contemptible.</p>
                  <p>But to draw neerer to the very definition of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> it being defined by muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is requiſite to be known that in all motion, according to the Philoſophers, there are many things conſiderable, the point from which, the point to which, the <hi>medium</hi> through which motion is made, motion, the mover, and the moveable: All theſe things are perpetually found in a <hi>Criſis.</hi> For the <hi>Mover</hi> is Nature it ſelf, performing coctions, ſeparating humors, and at laſt expelling them on the Critical day. The <hi>Moveable</hi> is the Morbifick cauſe, and preternatural humors, to which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153522:55"/>only a <hi>Criſis</hi> is incident. <hi>The point from which</hi> a <hi>Criſis</hi> is derived, is the augmentation of the diſeaſe, for a <hi>Criſis</hi> is in a diſeaſe; and according to the various nature of a diſeaſe, the <hi>Criſis</hi> is more ſlowly or ſwiftly exerciſed: for acute diſeaſes are ſooner judged of, long more ſlowly.</p>

                     <hi>The point in which</hi> the <hi>Criſis</hi> ends, is Health, or Death, or a ſtate neighbouring upon them, or a tranſition into ſome other <hi>ſpecies</hi> of diſeaſe. But the <hi>Medium thorough which,</hi> is all that interval of time extending from the augmentation to the ſolution of the diſeaſe, in which nature elaborates Concoction, Secretion, and Excretion.</p>
                  <p>But this motion of the <hi>Criſis</hi> is not ſimple, but doubly compound, of Local and Alterative; and natural and violent. <hi>Local motion</hi> is cauſed in <hi>Criſis</hi> by reaſon of the morbifical cauſe, moved and agitated by nature, and diſcuſſed by the uſnal wayes. But <hi>Alterative motion</hi> is cauſed by reaſon of the patient body, whether it be <hi>corruptive,</hi> as appears in a deadly <hi>Criſis,</hi> or <hi>perfective,</hi> as is evident in an healthy <hi>Criſis.</hi> Secondly, this motion is <hi>natural</hi> in reſpect of nature, the internal principle, and mover, effecting the <hi>Criſis</hi> primarily, and by it ſelf: but violent in reſpect of the skirmiſh, perturbation, and ſudden mutation. A <hi>Criſis</hi> therefore is oppoſitely termed mutation, and that ſwift, and ſudden, that it may thus be diſtinguiſhed from coction, the contention and ſecretion: as alſo from the ſlow and procraſtinated ſolution of long affects; hence this celerity affords a proper, and peculiar difference. But the reſidue of the definition is ſo obvious by it ſelf, that it needs no explication.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIrſt</hi> then a perfect and healthy <hi>Criſis,</hi> muſt preſent us with the token of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction upon the day of indication; for every critical day hath its index, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth is the index of the ſeventh, the eleventh of the fourteenth, the ſeventeenth of the twentieth. In theſe dayes, I ſay, the ſigns of concoction muſt appear, that a perfect healthy <hi>Criſis</hi> may follow. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that is in conjunction with ſome notable evacuation, <hi>viz.</hi> with excretion, or abſceſſion. <hi>For thoſe which are alleviated without manifeſt excretion, do uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe</hi> (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Prognoſtickes)</hi> this is confirmed by the authority of the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in many ſtories in his <hi>Epidemicks,</hi> among which this moſt notorious one ſhall ſerve in ſtead of all the reſt. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Book.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Egr.</hi> 2. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was rid of a feaver the fourteenth day, without ſweat, on the ſeventeenth day the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153522:56"/>feaver returns to him again, on the twentieth it leaves him, without ſweat, this unwelcome gueſt preſuming upon its former entertainment viſits him again, on the twenty fourth, at laſt on the twenty ſeventh he dies. For if the ſolution of a diſeaſe happen without critical cauſes, it wants not its danger; and if it end with a notable excretion or abſceſſion, it is judged to be a <hi>Criſis</hi> preſaging health. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it muſt happen on a critical day; for on thoſe dayes nature, being admitted to commodious operation, doth uſually cauſe a preſent and copious expulſion of noxious humors, and contrive uſeful excretions; which if they fall on another day, ſpeak nature to be moleſted, and to operate tumultuouſly. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it muſt be true, and not leave behind any reliques of the diſeaſe, which may endanger a recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it muſt be ſecure, that is eaſily tolerable by the ſick perſon, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dangerous ſymptomes. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Criſis</hi> muſt agree with the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the diſeaſe, and the nature of the ſick perſon, and ſuitable to his age, and temper. Acute diſeaſes are uſualliy judged by excretion, long by abſceſſion. A burning Feaver is in a young man judged by the flux of blood, in an old man by the flux of the belly.</p>
                  <p>A perfect deadly <hi>Criſis,</hi> hath contrary conditions to the healthy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are eaſily made out by the forementioned conditions, if we turn thoſe to the contrary which are propoſed to make up an healthy <hi>Criſis.</hi> But of theſe amongſt the reſt the firſt is moſt conſiderable, that <hi>Criſis</hi> being moſt deadly which is not uſher'd in by the precedent ſigns of concoction. For if upon no appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, there ariſe any perturbation, and evacuation of humors, it is an undoubted ſignal, that nature by the abuſive malignity of humors is provoked to a diſtemper. Whence it is, that ſhe runs too faſt for the gradual progreſs of coction to arrive in her company to a ſtation, and then we may confidently aſſert the <hi>Criſis</hi> is not ſafe: and the leſs, according to the dangerous nature of the diſeaſe. For in an healthy diſeaſe, and a leſs dangerous one it is formidable leſt it ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued in the judgment, and afterwards the diſeaſe ſhould return with more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous ſymptomes, or continuing longer ſhould be determined by death. <hi>For Coctions</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) <hi>ſhew the quickneſs of judgment, and the ſecurity of the diſeaſe; but crude and inconcoct excretions purged by bad abſceſſions are ſigns of pains, diuturnity, or acriſies, or death, or relapſe.</hi> For theſe inconveniences ariſe, when the <hi>Criſis</hi> can by no means be forejudged, whence it appears that the conditions and cuſtomes of nature are wholly aboliſhed, and vanquiſhed by the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, nor that it can be expected, that victory ſhould return in the <hi>Criſis,</hi> becauſe in the fight nature diſplayed no enſignes of victory, which alwayes happens in a mutual repugnancy, for he who is likely to conquer his Antagoniſt, ſhews in every point of motion that he hath ſubjected his enemy, though he bring back the marks of repaſſion. But when no ſigne of prevalence appears, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implies the deſtruction and downfal of a faculty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An imperfect</hi> Chriſis <hi>is that in which the diſeaſe is not perfectly judged, but onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and leaves room for another</hi> Criſis <hi>to ſucceed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this is twofold, one to melioration, the other to detriment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That tends to melioration which frees not the ſick perſon wholly of the diſeaſe, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an alacrity in bearing it.</hi>

                  <p>

                     <head>A COROLLARY.</head>
                     <p>The propoſed differences of the <hi>Criſis</hi> are knotted with ſome difficulties which are here to be reſolved. For <hi>firſt,</hi> it may be proved by the following arguments, that there is no perfect healthy or deadly <hi>criſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If there were a perfect healthy <hi>criſis,</hi> when that were conſummate, perfect health would be the ſequel of it. But after a <hi>criſis</hi> health is in a very languid and imperfect condition, and all the actions perſiſting weak and infirm, are ſymptomes rather of a morbous conſtitution, than of health.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There can be no tranſition from one extreme to another, without the help of a <hi>medium.</hi> But a neutrality of ſtate is the <hi>medium</hi> between diſeaſe and health. Therefore in every <hi>criſis</hi> there will be a change to that natural ſtate, but not to perfect ſanity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They who are in a way of recovery, having eſcaped the danger of a diſeaſe by a <hi>criſis,</hi> are in the ſame manner preſerved as ſick perſons. But this were inconſiſtent, if a <hi>criſis</hi> were perfect and healthy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a deadly <hi>criſis</hi> alſo cannot be termed perfect, when death the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it, is a pure deſtruction, and contrary to perfection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Every <hi>criſis</hi> is perfected by Nature, and all her actions perpetually aim in a direct tendency at good. Therefore no <hi>criſis</hi> can be deadly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the firſt, ſecond, and third,</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>criſis</hi> is called perfectly healthy, after which no particle of morbifick matter is left in the body which may give a reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to a diſeaſe; but though ſanity in its perfection be not immediately ſucceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to the <hi>criſis,</hi> but only a neutral ſtate of recovery, yet this depends not upon preternatural matter, but onely upon the languidneſs and imbecility of the parts neceſſarily introduced by the violence of the now departed diſeaſe. Therefore we may affirm, that at that time ſanity is perfect, at leaſt in reſpect of the morbifical cauſe, which was wholly evacuated. And this is a ſufficient ground for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect healthy <hi>criſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the fourth</hi> we anſwer, That in a deadly <hi>criſis</hi> there is a deſtruction as to the <hi>individuum,</hi> and the body diſeaſed, but this is no impediment to perfection in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>criſis</hi> it ſelf, which though it be deſtructively exerciſed, yet when it is wholly finiſhed it may be called as it were perfect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the fifth</hi> I anſwer, That Nature propoſeth alwayes to it ſelf the beſt end, yet often errs in her collimation, when ſhe is very infirm, and for want of ſtrength can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take the mark, but is forced to a burdenſome ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Two ſtories related by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> may be objected againſt the firſt condition of a perfect healthy <hi>criſis,</hi> the firſt of which we find, 1 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. where he reports that one <hi>Meto</hi> without any ſymptomes of concoction was judged perfectly to health. The other may be read, 3 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. where he alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that one <hi>Lariſſaea</hi> a Maid was perfectly judged without the ſignes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. But this objection may be enervated two wayes:</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> we ſay with <hi>Galen</hi> that thoſe Hiſtories are rare, and as to nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, therefore eſpecially noted by <hi>Hippocrates. Galen</hi> alſo admires <hi>in his comm.</hi> that no recidivation followed upon thoſe <hi>criſes,</hi> becauſe they appeared not according to the cuſtome of nature, nor the ordinary rule of an healthy <hi>criſis.</hi> We ſay <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That thoſe <hi>criſes</hi> were healthy, becauſe in the beginning there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded many evacuations, and thoſe laudable enough, and many followed the <hi>criſis;</hi> as by thoſe Hiſtories appears. Yet although they were as it were ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153522:57"/>becauſe they came forth in the beginning without the ſignes of coction, yet they are in ſome manner deemed to be critical, as being cauſed by the force of oppreſſed nature, and ſwelling matter; or at leaſt we may call them mix'd, <hi>viz.</hi> partly critical, partly ſymptomatical, which by diminiſhing the morbifick matter, can effect, that the ſucceeding <hi>Criſis</hi> be terminated in ſalubrity, eſpecially when other evacuations followed it. For after judgement <hi>Meto</hi> frequently bled at the noſe, and the moneths of <hi>Lariſſaea</hi> iſſued, which never appeared, and therefore no recidivation followed upon it.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo be <hi>objected,</hi> That nature can critically evacuate the noxious humors while they are tumid, without the ſymptomes of coction, when it may be lawful for a Phyſician by the precept of our divine Sire, to cauſe purgations, when the matter ſwels without any expectation of concoction. To this <hi>it muſt be anſwered,</hi> in the beginnings of diſeaſes nature being oppreſſed by the ſwelling matter, can cauſe onely mix'd evacuations, <hi>viz.</hi> partly critical, and partly ſymptomatical, not perfect <hi>Criſes</hi> through defect of concoction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Againſt the fifth condition of an healthy <hi>Criſis, viz.</hi> that it muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that is, eaſily tolerable by the ſick perſon, and without dangerous ſymptoms, authority, reaſon, and experience may be <hi>oppoſed.</hi> For <hi>Hippocrates, Aph.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. affirms, that a night troubleſome and dangerous is the forerunner of an approaching <hi>Criſis,</hi> and <hi>Galen chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>of Criſes,</hi> aſſerts, that divers ſymptomes, and theſe moſt perillous, as perturbation, deliration, difficult reſpiration, toſſings, inequality of pulſe, and critical vacuations are its anteambuloes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A <hi>criſis</hi> cannot happen, but after a conflict of nature with the diſeaſe; and this contention cannot be without the exacerbation of ſymptomes: for nature and the diſeaſes doe mutually act and ſuffer, by which means the body of the ſick perſon is neceſſarily tortured: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> experience teacheth, that no <hi>criſis</hi> (how healthy ſoever) can be exerciſed without vehemency of ſymptomes; and great diſturbance of the ſick perſon. To theſe <hi>we anſwer,</hi> that in a <hi>criſis</hi> many ſymptomes exert themſelves, but they are not dangerous, for where the ſtrength is firm, and vigorous, the ſymptomes, which are alwayes more gentle in an healthy <hi>criſis,</hi> cannot inferre any danger. For when they are very vehement, they por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a deadly <hi>criſis,</hi> or at leaſt an imperfect one, and poſting on to worſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Againſt the laſt condition of an healthy <hi>criſis, viz.</hi> that it muſt agree with the diſeaſe, and the nature of the party diſeaſed, ſo that acute diſeaſes may be judged by excretions, long ones by abſceſſions. As <hi>Galen, chap.</hi> 7. <hi>book</hi> 3. <hi>of criſes.</hi> Beſides peſtilent feavers, which are acute to extremity, are eaſed by botches and carbuncles. Long diſeaſes alſo are not onely judged by abſceſſions, but alſo by excretions. Nor do theſe <hi>Criſes</hi> conform to the nature of the ſick perſon, for acute feavers in young men are terminated not only by flux of blood, but alſo by ſweat, urine, and flux of the belly, which happen indiſcriminate in old men. To all theſe it muſt be <hi>anſwered,</hi> That the condition propoſed is true, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and neceſſarily, but for the moſt part; for nature hath its ordinary motions, which ſometimes changes according to the various conditions and diſpoſition of the matter, ſo that the matter which at ſuch age was uſually evacuated by nature, by flux of blood, if it be not placed in the inferiour parts, is more conveniently ſent away by urine, or the flux of the belly.</p>

                  <head type="sub">There are three Orders of Critical Signes; ſome termed antecedent, ſome concomitant, others ſubſequent.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Antecedent</hi> are again of two ſorts, ſome prognoſticating the time of <hi>Criſes,</hi> ſome the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of them. The time of an approaching <hi>Criſis</hi> is known two wayes; by the acuteneſs of the diſeaſe, and by the ſignes of concoction, which are by us explicated, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Semiot. cha.</hi> 4. Thoſe ſignes foreſhow the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> which give notice by what place a <hi>Criſis</hi> is to come, <hi>viz.</hi> either by vomit, flux of the belly, ſweats, urines, flux of the blood, moneths, hemorrhoids, or abſceſſion: which were all explained by us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Semiot. chap.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Signes concomitating the <hi>Criſis</hi> are thoſe which appear in company with the very <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the <hi>Criſis,</hi> demonſtrating whether the <hi>Criſis</hi> it ſelf now being be good or bad, perfect or imperfect. And they are the very cauſes and critical <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which are onely two, excretion and abſceſſion.</p>
                  <p>That excretion ought to be called healthy and good which is made conveniently; but that it may be ſo, foure things are requiſite, a laudable quality, a moderate quantity, an opportune time, and the manner of excretion familiar to nature.</p>
                  <p>The quality of the excreted humor is laudable, if both the peccant and cocted humor be evacuated. The quantity is moderate, which is neither defective but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, nor immoderate, for the exiguity of it is condemned and ſuſpected, ſuch as dropping of blood, inconſiderable tranſpirations by ſweat, ſmal vomits; the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate wants not its danger. The opportunity of time is the Critical day, excretions happening on other days give cauſe of ſuſpicion. The manner of excretion is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to nature, if they be at firſt copious, and flow not out ſlowly and by little; next, if they be thruſt out through places conducible and agreeable to the laws of nature.</p>
                  <p>But that evacuation may be made by convenient places, three things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the place be not more worthy than that in which the diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: <hi>Next,</hi> That it be direct: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That it have open paſſages.</p>
                  <p>That the abſceſſion may be legitimate, three things are to be noted, <hi>whither, from whence,</hi> and <hi>for what cauſe. Whither</hi> ſignifies the part in which it dwels, which muſt be an inferior one, ignoble, and remote from the affected part, and capable of the whole morbifick matter, otherwiſe there will be danger of a reflux. <hi>From whence,</hi> denotes the part from which, the right or left; for the decumbency muſt be direct. <hi>For what cauſe,</hi> ſhews us the cauſe, by reaſon of which this abſceſſion is made; that is, whether from Nature, the diſeaſe being concocted, or from the matter collecting it, and the crude humor yet troubling it; for if there happen an abſceſſion while the diſeaſe is crude, it will be ſmall, and not perfectly demonſtrate the diſeaſe. All theſe are particularly by us explained, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Semiot. chap.</hi> 2. when we make an inſpection into the ſigns, drawn from the excrements flowing by divers parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>The conſequent ſigns of a <hi>Criſis</hi> ſhew whether it be perfect, and whether our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation will not be deluded, if we look for perfect health thereupon, or whether it be imperfect, to a danger of recidivation. And theſe are taken from the actions, excrements, and qualities of the body, in which if there be but a ſmall receſs from a a natural ſtate, the excretion was healthy; but if there be a wide recoil, the <hi>criſis</hi> is imperfect, and there will be danger of recidivation. Theſe alſo will require explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in the laſt ch. of the Prognoſtick part,</hi> in which are propounded the ſignes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent relapſe in thoſe who are in way of recovery.</p>

                  <p>THeſe dayes more frequently produce frequent and healthy <hi>Criſe's,</hi> becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them chiefly when ſhe operates to purpoſe, and gets the day abſolutely againſt the power of the diſeaſe, ſhe (like a ſtout virago) challenges the morbifick cauſe to a ſingle duel, which ſhe routs out of the field by convenient paſſages. But theſe are the three Septenaries, becauſe Nature delights in a Septenary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For in the ſeventh moneth it quickens the Embryo to life, in the ſeventh yeer of our age we ſhew our teeth, at the fourteenth the moneths flow, and every Septenary cauſeth notable mutations in Men: The firſt of theſe is the ſeventh, not onely by a prerogative of order, but alſo by a ſuperiority of power and ſtrength, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Of Decret. dayes, chap.</hi> 4. Comparing it with a King, admirable for clemency, who pardons many, and ſecures them from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, who mitigates the puniſhment of perſons condemned; for moſt uſually the <hi>Criſe's</hi> happening on theſe dayes are good and healthy. But if ſome be caſually bad, they are not ſo pernicious as another day would make them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the fourteenth, in which thoſe diſeaſes are judged, on which by reaſon of the matter not yet well concocted, judgement could not be paſſed on the ſeventh; but if an haſty <hi>Criſis</hi> happen before the fourteenth it is not perfect, but is cauſed by the irritation of Nature, or the plenty or quality of the matter. For Critical dayes being numbred by weeks, the fourteenth is the end of the ſecond week, which cauſed <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to term it uneven, as not being conſidered from the firſt day of the diſeaſe, but from the firſt day of the ſecond week. By it alſo acute diſeaſes are terminated, according to <hi>Hippocrates, Aph.</hi> 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, <hi>Acute diſeaſes are judged in fourteen dayes:</hi> Which he alſo confirms <hi>in Coac. Fourteen dayes judge of burning feavers, ſentencing either to death or to health.</hi> Yet many Hiſtories delivered in his <hi>Epidemicks</hi> ſeem to enervate the truth of this affertion; which ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are of thoſe, who having acute feavers were produced beyond the fourteenth day. <hi>Herophon</hi> judged on the ſeventeenth, <hi>Philinius</hi> his Wife dyed on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth; <hi>Chaerion</hi> judged on the twentieth; but all theſe were troubled with acute feavers. To which <hi>objection it muſt be anſwered,</hi> that Diſeaſes truely acute accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vote of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are thoſe which are ſwiftly, continently, and vehemently rooted, nor do they attain to the title of acute, till they begin to be vehement; though then ſome diſeaſes he judged the ſeventeenth, and the twentieth day, as to the beginning of the diſeaſe, yet they are alwayes judged on the fourteenth as to the vehemency thereof. For ſuch diſeaſes as are judged the ſeventeenth or twentieth day, do not preſume to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153522:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>violent and impetuous ſo ſoon as they drop from their cauſes, but after a little pauſe. So thoſe which began to be violent on the end of the fourth day, though they were conſummate on the ſeventeenth, yet doubtleſs they were judged on the fourteenth after their violence; and thoſe which appeared violent on the ſeventh, judged on the twentieth, have a ſolution on the fourteenth of their violence. Whence <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>Commentary on the mentioned Aphoriſme,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That no one was ever found, which was ſo ſwiftly moved from the beginning, that it paſſed this boundary, which did not receive ſome mutation by the dayes aforeſaid.</hi> For though an acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe end ſometimes on the ſeventeenth, or twentieth day, yet we have found it judged within its fourteenth, if we compute from that day in which the diſeaſe begins to be more ſwift and vehement: Which appears by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his hiſtory of a young man in <hi>Meliboea,</hi> who fell to deliration the tenth day, was quite mad the twentieth, and died the twenty fourth: by which it is evident that he deceaſed on the fourteenth day of vehemency, which began but on the tenth day of the diſeaſe. But though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth ſome diſeaſes acute, which are extended to the fortyeth or ſixtyeth day, yet they are not truely and properly acute, becauſe they are not vehement and impetuous, but ſlow in progreſs; and are therefore from their decidence commonly called acute, whereas they are produced from acute diſeaſes judged by an imperfect <hi>Criſis,</hi> or proceed unequally, by reaſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal change of remiſſion and exacerbation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third of the principal dayes is the twentieth, which is the ſeventh from the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, the fourteenth being here numbred, for it is the laſt of the ſecond week, and the firſt of the third, as</hi> Hippocrates <hi>informs us,</hi> Aph. 24. Sect. 2. <hi>where chiefly obſerving the indicative dayes,</hi> he ſaith, The ſeventeenth day is worth Contemplation, becauſe it is the fourth from the fourteenth: <hi>Whence we muſt neceſſarily inferre, that the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth is the ſeventh from the fourteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame thing <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirms in many ſtories in his <hi>Epidemicks,</hi> as in that of <hi>Chaerion,</hi> in the wife of <hi>Philinus,</hi> and in the daughter of <hi>Euryanax,</hi> who were judged the twentieth day. But in others judged after the twentieth, there happened <hi>Criſe's</hi> in the fourths and ſevenths by computation from the twentieth. So <hi>Abderitana</hi> a Maid was judged the twenty fourth, <hi>Anaxion</hi> the thirty fourth.</p>
                  <p>But yet we may <hi>oppoſe</hi> to this tenet, that the ſame <hi>Hippocrates, Aphoriſm.</hi> 36. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. omitting the twentieth, reckons the twenty firſt amongſt the Decretory dayes; for, ſaith he, <hi>ſweats are good for decumbents in feavers, which are evaporated on the third, the fifth, ſeventh, ninth, eleventh, fourteenth, ſeventeenth, and one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth dayes.</hi> The ſame he confirms <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Epid. in the book of Decretory dayes,</hi> in which he ſets down the twenty firſt, omitting the twentyeth.</p>
                  <p>To unravel this difficulty we <hi>muſt anſwer,</hi> That the <hi>Criſe's</hi> contingent in the third week, moſt frequently take up part in the twentieth and twenty firſt, ſo that ſomething <hi>Hippocrates</hi> might well referre the <hi>Criſis</hi> to the twenty firſt. Yet it were more rational to call that the Critical day, in which the <hi>Criſis</hi> begins, then that in which it ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The indicative dayes, which are called contemplable and Meſſengers, are thoſe which denuntiate the drawing near of the</hi> Criſis <hi>on the ſeptenaries: and they are in number three, the fourth, the eleventh, and the fourteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are called Contemplable becauſe by the Contemplation of them we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the approach of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> and for this cauſe they are therefore called meſſengers, and more frequently indicative, becauſe they ſhew and foretell the day deſigned for the coming of the <hi>Criſis;</hi> and that by the ſigns of concoction, appearing chiefly in the Urine: whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Prognoſticks and Aphoriſms</hi> averres,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:153522:59"/>That Urine iſſuing the fourth day which hath white hypoſtaſis ſmooth and equal do Prognoſtick a ſolution of the diſeaſe on the ſeventh day. But of the principal dayes every one hath its index: <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth is the index of the ſeventh, the eleventh of the fourteenth, the ſeventeenth of the twentieth. But thoſe days are alſo reckoned among the Critical, as not being ſimply indicative, but becauſe in them <hi>Criſe's</hi> do not ſeldome happen, though leſs perfect ones.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe therefore the fourth day is the firſt, which primarily, by it ſelf and of its own nature is the index of the ſeventh, as <hi>Galen</hi> hath diligently obſerved, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>book</hi> 2. <hi>of the decretory dayes,</hi> where he inſtructeth us that that Criſis, appears the fourth day by its antecedent ſigns of concoction, which without the objection of an impediment will happen the ſeaventh day. For many things may ſtop the motion of nature not in the ſeventh alone, but in every Critical day, <hi>viz.</hi> either as to the ſick perſon himſelf, or the Phyſician, the attendants, who are incident to many errors: So that if on the ſeventh day the Phyſician preſcribe a purgative, if the ſick perſon, or the attendants be diſobedient, and pervert the right uſe both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and not natural things. But the fourth day is to be placed among the decretories, for it diſcovers diſeaſes peracute to extremity, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth in his <hi>prognoſtickes,</hi> for, ſaith he, <hi>The moſt gentle Feavers, and thoſe that are confirmed by the ſecureſt ſigns, end the fourth day or ſooner; but the moſt malignant, and thoſe which are attended by dreadful ſymptomes, kill the fourth day or ſooner.</hi> So in his <hi>Epidemicks,</hi> Pericles on the fourth day with the breaking forth of an univerſal ſweat, died by a moſt acute Feaver. <hi>Calvus Lariſeus,</hi> had a pain in his right thigh, on the fourth days he dyed very ſuddenly and acutely. Yet theſe <hi>Criſe's</hi> are very rare, which happen on the fourth day, for they more frequently fall out on the third or fifth, becauſe the exacerbations of acute diſeaſes are cauſed on odde dayes. But on the ſame dayes the diſeaſes, from whence theſe exacerbations proceed, are diſcovered, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught in <hi>Epid.</hi> and hence <hi>Galen</hi> averres, that he obſerved but onely once a <hi>Criſis</hi> on the fourth day, but <hi>Archigenes</hi> twice.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of the Indicatives is the Eleventh, which yet doth not ſo perfectly demonſtrate the fourteenth, as the fourth doth the ſeventh. For as the ſtrength of the dayes perfectly judging is by degrees diminiſhed; ſo is the vertue of the indicatives alſo, whereas the ſpeedier the <hi>Criſes</hi> arrive to perfection, they ſhew the greater predominancy of nature over the morbifick cauſe, and by how much the longer they are protracted, they ſhew a greater inſufficiency, or at leaſt obſtinacy of the matter, and therefore judgment cannot be ſo infallibly; and orderly paſſed on them; but the eleventh day doth not only act an index, but a judge; but not ſo perfectly, and frequently, as the truely Critical: and many examples are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Epidemicks,</hi> of thoſe, which have been judged the eleventh day, and <hi>Galen chap.</hi> 7. <hi>book</hi> 1. <hi>of decretory dayes,</hi> relates that one autumn, he obſerved that all were judged the eleventh day.</p>
                  <p>The third of the Indicatives is the ſeventeenth, which doth not ſo ſurely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, as the fourth, and eleventh, but judges much more powerfully, and is by <hi>Galen</hi> and other Authors reckoned among the more ſtrong Criticals. Yet <hi>Archigenes</hi> and others, which number the dayes whole, and ſo the one and twentieth, not the twentieth, make it a true Critical day, and admit the eighteenth for an index, not the ſeventeenth, whom <hi>Galen</hi> encounters with a large refutation, 2. <hi>of decretory days, chap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The intervening dayes, which are alſo called leap-dayes, irrepent, or provocatory days, which are annumerated to the principals, and fal between the indicatives, endeavouring imperfect</hi> Criſes, <hi>are the third, fifth, ninth, thirteenth, and nineteenth dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:153522:59"/>
                  <p>They are called <hi>Provocatory,</hi> becauſe they ſometimes tempt nature to excretion, whence a <hi>Criſis</hi> happens ſome times in them, but an imperfect one, becauſe it proceeds from the unſeaſonable and inconvenient irritation of nature. Every week hath its intercident dayes. For the firſt hath two, the third and the fifth; the ſecond hath alſo two, the ninth and the thirteenth; But the third hath but one, <hi>viz.</hi> the nineteenth. But theſe dayes are in ſome manner Critical, becauſe odde. And acute diſeaſes are heightened to an exacerbation in odde dayes, and in thoſe exacerbations <hi>Criſes</hi> uſually happen, becauſe then nature is provoked to excretion. Yet theſe <hi>Criſes</hi> which are cauſed by irritation are imperfect, as is before ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the other dayes which are neither principal, nor indicative, nor intercident, are called vacant and Medicinal dayes, and they are, the ſixth, the eighth, the tenth, the twelfth, the ſixteenth, and the eighteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are termed <hi>Vacant,</hi> becauſe they neither judge, nor diſcover, nor provoke, nor any are in manner Critical: and if a <hi>criſis</hi> happens in them, it is bad. But they are called <hi>Medicinal,</hi> becauſe in them all kinds of Phyſick, and ſo purgatives may be with ſafety adminiſtred, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth in a clauſe worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, in his <hi>fourth of diſeaſes. Whoſoever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>being aggrieved by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver, uſe a cathartick on the even dayes, are never purged enough. But they who uſe a purgative on the odde dayes, are overmuch purged, and many have thereupon dyed.</hi> They may alſo be in ſome ſort called decretory, not ſimply, but with adjection, that they are bad decretories, for they are never nuntio's of health, but diſcover badly, treacherouſly and dangerouſly: becauſe the Criſis happening in thoſe dayes, proceed ſimply from the malignity of the diſeaſe, not from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or at leaſt the irritation of nature, as happens in provocatories. The moſt malignant of theſe is the ſixth, which <hi>Galen</hi> names a Tyrant, purely contrary to the ſeventh, by him named King. Therefore what <hi>criſes</hi> ſoever fall on the ſixth day are to be deemed moſt dangerous. <hi>An emanation of ſweat on the ſixth day, is very bad,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates in Coac.</hi> and in his <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> the Jaundies is the ſixth day deadly. But in the <hi>Epidemicks</hi> there are found many hiſtories to this purpoſe, as of the Wife of <hi>Dromeada, Hermocrates, Philiſcus,</hi> and many others, who were unhappy in the contingencies of <hi>criſes</hi> on the ſixth day. But it may be <hi>objected,</hi> out of <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>book</hi> 3. <hi>of Epidem.</hi> That <hi>Lariſſaea</hi> a Maid was judged to health on the ſixth day. <hi>We Anſwer</hi> with <hi>Galen,</hi> that this cauſally is very rare, and beyond the cuſtome of nature, for this <hi>criſis</hi> happened neither on a Critical day, nor were there any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſymptomes of concoction, as before was mentioned. But the cauſe of this healthy <hi>criſis</hi> is to be aſcribed to the rare, and extraordinary ſtrugling of nature, which endeavoured a triple evacuation in this Maid, <hi>viz.</hi> by the monthly purgations, by large flux of blood, and a torrent of ſweat. The ſame judgement will hold of the reſt even dayes to the twentieth. Although ſome Neotericks haue fanſyed, that ſanguin diſeaſes are judged on the even dayes, becauſe they are moved on the ſame; yet this is ſeldome ſeene, both for that in acute feavers, which are cauſed by blood, the blood doth eaſily degenerate into choler, or at leaſt the putredinous part of it, or for that <hi>criſes</hi> do not ſimply follow exacerbations, but much rather a ſuperior cauſe, which ſhall be more largely declared, in the <hi>chap. of cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Critical dayes are alſo numbred from the twentieth to the fortieth by ſeptenaries, the twenty ſeventh, the thirty fourth, and the fortieth. From the fortieth to the hundred and twentieth by vicenaries, the ſixtieth, eightieth, hundreth, hundred and twentieth, but after this the ſtrength of the Critical dayes is ſpent, and then</hi> Criſes <hi>are ſaid to happen by moneths and years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief, and more ordinary Critical dayes are thoſe, which uſually happen in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153522:60"/>acute diſeaſes; But theſe acute diſeaſes if they begin with violence are judged the fourteenth day, or ſooner, but if they begin not to move ſwiftly, and vehemently, before the end of the firſt week, they are extended to the twentieth, which by this means terminates acute diſeaſes. But thoſe diſeaſes which reach beyond the twentieth, are called acute by decidence, and in theſe <hi>Criſes</hi> happen, but not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and ſo they are numbred not as before by quaternaries, but by ſeptena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the fortieth, in which their ſtrength is decayed, and the dayes are numbred by vicenaries only to the hundred and twentieth, in which alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> relates contin gencies of both healthy, and deadly <hi>Criſes,</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. Where we read <hi>Heropytus</hi> was perfectly, and healthfully judged on the hundred and twentieth day. <hi>Pacius</hi> in <hi>Thaſis,</hi> died on the hundred and twentieth. Beyond that time the vertue of Critical dayes reacheth not, but afterwards the <hi>Criſes,</hi> or rather the changes of the body happen in moneths, or years, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Aph.</hi> 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Many diſeaſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in children are judged, ſome in forty dayes, ſome in ſeven Moneths, ſome in ſeven Years, ſome upon their arrival to puberty.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Computation of Critical dayes muſt be made from that hour, in which the ſick perſon perceives a manifeſt leſion of his actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot compute the Critical dayes, unleſs we certainly ſtate the beginning of the whole diſeaſe, which muſt be deduced from the very hour in which the perſon ſicken'd, for from that to the like hour of the day following, is reckon'd the firſt day, and the other conſequently. But it is very difficult to ſtate this hour, and many errors are often committed in it; whereas vulgar Phyſicians compute the beginning of the diſeaſe from the hour of taking bed, which may indeed hit right in delicate and effeminate men who upon the lighteſt touch of pain, preſently keep their bed, but in men more ſtrong and accuſtomed to labour, it is very falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereas they by the aſſuefaction bear the diſeaſe, but now creeping on, nor yet troubleſome, for many dayes; nor retain to their bed, till they are ſupplanted by the oppreſſive violence of the diſeaſe. Therefore the true computation muſt be inſtituted from that very hour, in which we perceive a ſenſible leſion of actions in the party diſeaſed, <hi>viz.</hi> by which, he could not dine or ſup, or according to his cuſtome walke, or perform other uſual offices: in ſhort from that time in which he began to be feveriſh, if it be a primary, not a ſymptomatical feaver. But becauſe a feaver is ſeldome known by the ſick perſon, or his aſſiſtants, therefore the Phyſician by the relation of ſymptomes, and their firſt invaſion eaſily deduceth the feaver it ſelf from the beginning. But there is one true ſign often occurring in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a feaver, <hi>viz.</hi> that acute diſeaſes do often invade us with coldneſs and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If therefore the ſick perſon relate to the Phyſician that in the beginning of his ſickneſs he perceived a chilneſs and trembling ſuch an hour, that hour will be truely the beginning of the diſeaſe, from which the Critical dayes are to be computed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In a Woman in labour, troubled with an acute feaver, if the birth be natural, the computation of the Critical dayes muſt be from the feaver, not from the birth; but if the birth be preternatural, the computation is to be made from the birth, not from the Feaver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Theoreme includes a very difficult queſtion, and much intricate, as being oppoſed by no leſs authority then of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, and fortified on both parts with very ſinewy difficulties of reaſon. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. <hi>Progn. Aph.</hi> 12. ſaith, <hi>In like manner judgment is paſſed in Women from the birth.</hi> And <hi>Galen in his comment on that place,</hi> confirms the opinion by theſe words: <hi>Let the beginning of reckoning be made, not from that day in which they were feaveriſh, but from that in which they brought forth; in ſome therefore they begin about the ſecond, or third day after parturition, from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153522:60"/>which many number the future judgement: but erroniouſly, for the numeration of dayes is to be inſtituted, from that in which they brought forth.</hi> Which precept <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> hath alſo brought into his practice, 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>and Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>of the ſame book Aegr.</hi> 14. In which place he tells us ſtories of many women in parturition troubled with an acute diſeaſe, in whom the days were computed from the very day of birth. This may be reeſtabliſhed by a very pregnan treaſon; For it ſeems the beginning of the diſeaſe is to be contemporary with the firſt motion of the humor: But the humor begins to be moved in the day of bringing forth, for then begins nature to ſtruggle, and then the humors are agitated, therefore from this agitation of humors the computation muſt be made. But on the contrary the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Aegr.</hi> 4. In the Wife of <hi>Philinus,</hi> which on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day after delivery, was taken ſick of a feaver, reckons the dayes from the day of the feaver, not of the birth. So <hi>Aegr.</hi> 5. <hi>following.</hi> In the Wife of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> which begun to be feaveriſh the ſecond day after parturition, he inſtitutes his computation from the feaver, not from parturition. As alſo <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. <hi>of the ſame book</hi> in the Wife of <hi>Dromeada,</hi> which on the ſecond day after delivery, was taken with a Cold, and acute Feaver, he makes the ſame computation from the day of the feaver, not of delivery, This opinion alſo is compared with ſtrong fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reaſon. For if the computation ought in any reaſon to be made from the day of delivery, it would be chiefly this, becauſe of the motion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in parturition: but this motion is not a ſufficient cauſe: for though the matter be never ſo much moved occaſionally before the feaver; yet nevertheleſs the computation begins from the feaver it ſelf, not from the motion. So in a violent exercitation of the body, cauſing a feaver, the computation muſt not be deduced from the exercitation, in which the commotion of humors was made, but only from the ſubſequent feaver. This controverſy is determined in the propoſed Theoreme. For Birth is natural or preternatural. And theſe are differenced by the gravity and levity of ſymptomes, and principally by expurgation, which in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral birth proceeds in due order: in preternatural is ſuppreſſed. If therefore the birth be natural, a woman within the time of expurgation cannot, unleſs by reaſon of ſome procatarctick cauſe, be taken with a feaver, as being duly purged from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements. But if the birth be preternatural, it is evident that it inveſts it ſelf in the nature of the diſeaſe, offending very many operations. And ſo, the feaver ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding this morbous birth, is deemed to depend upon the birth it ſelf, and ſo fals under the notion of a ſymptomatical feaver; and the computation of the dayes which ought to be made from the original of the diſeaſe, muſt be made from the morbous birth. This <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved in his <hi>Aegr.</hi> above propounded: for the Women there mentioned <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>book</hi> 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> had a preternatural birth, for the two firſt, were abortive; but the third was delivered with much pain. As alſo ſhe mentioned in <hi>hiſt.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. brought forth with great difficulty, and without much purgation. Therefore in theſe four <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes his computation from the day of birth, but in the others related <hi>in hiſt.</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>book</hi> 2. the birth was natural; for the Wife of <hi>Philinus</hi> brought forth a Female, with purgation according to nature, paſſing thorough the reſt with eaſe. The Wife of <hi>Epicrates</hi> was delivered of a Daughter, and all other things did orderly proceed. The Wife of <hi>Dromeada</hi> brought forth a Daughter alſo, with all other things according to order. Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> inſtitutes his computation in them from the day of the feaver, not of the birth. But againſt this deciſion of the controverſy we have another in arms, <hi>viz. Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> an Author otherwiſe very grave in his <hi>Schol. curat.</hi> 34. <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this anſwer of Hipp. is not ſatisfactory to the mind and of no moment;</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153522:61"/>this he endeavours to demonſtrate out of <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a woman in <hi>Thaſus,</hi> which having brought forth a Daughter without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, was the third day taken with an acute dreadful feaver; and <hi>Amatus</hi> is of opinion, that in her, computation was made from the day of the feaver, whereas it is not evident that the birth was preternatural, though without purgation. But that this computation was made from the day of the feaver, he collects from the following words of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which are contained in the Hiſtory: <hi>But after ſhe had been ſhaken with cold, continual feavers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That from this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Reader might underſtand the computation to be made from the third day after birth.</hi> But by this good mans leave we muſt tell him that his interpretation of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is bad, out of whoſe words nothing can be gathered but this, that from the third day of delivery a continual feaver followed, and the ſymptomes the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants thereof. And if we traverſe the whole Hiſtory, it will evidently appear that computation was made from the day of the birth, not of the feaver, as <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> learned Interpreters of the <hi>Epidemicks,</hi> confidently aſſert. And ſo the propoſed diſtinction containing the diviſion of the queſtion, will be agreeable to the mind of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But there intervenes yet one ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> Why <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3 <hi>Progn.</hi> abſolutely propoſing as it were a general rule, teacheth ſimply to compute from the day of birth? We <hi>muſt anſwer,</hi> That <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Books of <hi>Epid.</hi> obſerved various experiments, and many caſes, as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, from which he afterwards compoſed rules and canons, contained in his Prognoſticks and Aphoriſms, as <hi>Galen</hi> informs, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>of Decretory dayes, chap.</hi> 3. And the Canons are drawn from the moſt frequent contingencies; but it is uſual, that a feaver immediately ſucceeding upon parturition, depends upon the error of the birth, therefore for the moſt part computation is to be made from the birth. But it is ſeldome found, that when the birth is natural, a feaver ſhould ariſe, which at that time cannot proceed from any thing but a procatarctick and external cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Head wounds, and any other, the computation of the Critical dayes muſt be made from the day of the wound, not of the feaver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſon holds in a wound as in preternatural birth: for the feaver ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it is ſymptomatical, but the wound is the primary diſeaſe, from which the number of critical dayes muſt be deduced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In relapſes, the computation of the critical dayes muſt be inſtituted, from the beginning of the diſeaſe, not the relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Recidivation is cauſed by the reliques of the precedent diſeaſe, which were not wholly evacuated, and therefore is taken for the ſame diſeaſe, the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; in which indeed there happens a remiſſion of the feaver between the root of it and the relapſe, but not a true intermiſſion, as appears by the ſymptoms obſerved by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>If any thing of that which is effuſed, be left within, it inclines to relapſe, thirſt left within, exſiccation of the mouth, and inſuavity, by the ſame reaſon as all the reſt are ſignes of the imperfect ſolution of a diſeaſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe he that is ſurpriſed with a relapſe, is not yet fully freed from thoſe accidents, the computation muſt be one, for that the ſolution of the former affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not total, but partial only. So <hi>Hipp.</hi> in <hi>Epid.</hi> perpetually numbers the days from the precedent diſeaſe, never from the relapſe, as appears in the Hiſtories of <hi>Hermocrates, Anaxion, Herophon, Cleanactis</hi> Wife to <hi>Epicrates,</hi> and others.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the cauſes of a</hi> Criſis, <hi>and Critical dayes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A <hi>Criſis</hi> is a kind of a compound, comprehending Conturbation, Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſudden mutation to health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conturbation is a plenty of critical ſymptomes, ariſing from the agitation of morbiſick matter. But this agitation proceeds, either from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe, ſuch as of the Heavens, and the motions and influences of the ſtars: or from an internal, as from nature her ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HOw the influences of the Stars effect critical motions, ſhall be after explained. But now nature in a critical conturbation agitates the morbifick humors becauſe they being ſeparated from the laudable and gentle matter: provoke nature more, which upon this irritation is excited to expulſion, for though thoſe humors be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, yet they are not wholly reduced to gentleneſs; and therefore by moleſting nature with their acrimony and ſome malignant quality, they cauſe her to eaſe her ſelf of this trouble by excretionr.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The cauſe of Evacuation is the expulſive faculty, which excited either by the copiouſneſs or the quality of the matter, critically expels all moleſtations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The expulſive faculty is one of thoſe, which are termed natural ſubſervient, performing its duty by the help of native heat, and ſpirits, as alſo by the fibres implanted in every part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But why</hi> Criſis <hi>or critical evacuation happens in the ſeptenary and quaternary dayes, rather then at other times, depends upon the motion of the Moon as its principal cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cauſe of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> and the cauſe of critical dayes are to be diſtinguiſhed, as things differing in the whole latitude of the <hi>genus.</hi> For the cauſe of a <hi>Criſis</hi> is the expulſive faculty, thruſting out that which is troubleſome. But when we enquire after the cauſes of critical dayes, we obſerve not what expels the vitious humors out of the body, but why the expulſive faculty doth not uſe indifferently all, but ſome ſolemne dayes, on which it expels theſe troubleſome things more frequently, and eaſily: but this depends upon the motion of the Moon effecting theſe motions by her various aſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Moon is very predominant over theſe inferiour bodies, eſpecially over humid ones, cauſing in them notable mutations, chiefly in conjunctions, appoſitions and quadratures, in which</hi> Criſes <hi>uſually happen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What changes the Moon cauſeth by her various aſpects in this inferior world, and how by this means the winds and tempeſts are changed, how ſeed thrives, how crabs and ſhel fiſh are ſometimes full, ſometimes empty, is well enough known to Mariners, Husbandmen, and ordinary Women. But the chief ſubjects of this domineering Planet are humid bodies; whence it is no cauſe of wonder, that it ſhould have ſo much authority over the humors of our bodies, that it can move them on certain dayes, and by that excite a <hi>Criſis.</hi> This it moſt commonly does in its aſpects, by whoſe Arithmetick the critical dayes are numbred: for the firſt aſpect of the Moon is the Sextile, or left hexangle happening on the fourth day. The ſecond, quadrate or the left tetrangle, on the ſeventh day. The third called the left triangle, on the eleventh. The fourth called oppoſite, or diametral, on the fourteenth day. The fifth, the right triangle, on the ſeventeenth day. The ſixth, the tetrangle, or right quadrate, on the twentieth day. The ſeventh, the ſextile or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153522:62"/>right hexangle, on the foure and twentieth day. The eighth in conjunction, on the ſeven and twentieth day. But theſe days are extended to ſome latitude, as we ſhall hereafter inform; it will ſuffice here to note, that the Aſpects of the Moon and the Critical days have the ſame computation, which was propoſed in the <hi>precedent Chap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Motions of Critical dayes depend not on the Aſpects which the Moon hath with the Sun, but from thoſe which ſhe hath with the Signes of the Zodiack, and that place in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in which it was in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Criſes</hi> were moved by the appearances of the Moon with the Sun, there would be no order obſervable in Critical dayes, becauſe all ſick perſons, whatever day they began to be ſick, would on the ſame day be ſubject to a <hi>criſis;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the beginning of a full Moon, when ſhe oppoſeth the Sun; or in new Moon, when conjunction is cauſed, or in the quaternions. Therefore we muſt think that the <hi>criſes</hi> depend not on ſuch aſpects; but rather from the aſpects of the Moon to that Signe, and to that place of the Zodiack, in which it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the diſeaſe, and ſo on the ſeventh day of the diſeaſe the Moon is in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate aſpect to that place, and on the fourteenth in an oppoſite, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The computation of Critical dayes is not to be inſtituted according to the Synodical Month, which is alſo called the Moneth of Conjunction, nor according to the Moneth of Apparition or Illumination, nor according to the Medicinal Moneth, but according to the Periodical Moneth, or the Moneth of Peragration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Synodical</hi> Moneth is that time which intervenes between two conjunctions of the Sun and Moon, conſiſting of twenty nine dayes and thirteen hours, and ſo three weeks conſtitute not twenty, but two and twenty dayes and three hours: therefore according to this Moneth the computation of the Critical dayes cannot be made. The Moneth of <hi>Illumination</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> is the interval from the firſt ſight of the new Moon diſappearing to that day, and it is in ſpace twenty ſix dayes and twelve hours; nor can computation be made according to this Moneth, becauſe three weeks amount to onely nineteen dayes and twelve hours. The <hi>Periodical</hi> Moneth, or Moneth of <hi>Peragration,</hi> is that time in which the Moon poſts thorough the whole Zodiack, and returns to the ſame point ſhe left, and this is extended to twenty ſeven dayes and eight hours, and ſo three weeks will make up twenty dayes and twelve hours. This alſo <hi>Galen</hi> would not admit to conſtitute the order of Critical dayes, therefore he invented a new Moneth, which he called <hi>Medicinal,</hi> compounded of the <hi>Periodical,</hi> and the Moneth of <hi>Illumination,</hi> which two being united, make fifty three dayes and twenty hours, which account halfed makes twenty ſix dayes and twenty two hours, and this half conſtitutes <hi>Galen</hi>'s Medicinal Moneth, three weeks of which make twenty dayes and foure houres: But this Moneth of <hi>Galen</hi>'s, all, both Phyſicians and Aſtrologers reject and contemne as fictitious, portentous, and deviating from truth, whoſe reaſons for brevity ſake we omit, becauſe they are vulgarly known. It will be ſatisfactory to inform you, that the Decretory dayes are to be taken from the true motion of the Moon, which conſtitutes the Moneth of <hi>Peragration,</hi> and by which the forenamed aſpects are conſtituted. But that Moneth of <hi>Peragration</hi> as is before mentioned, conſiſts of twenty ſeven dayes and eight hours; and if it be divided into foure weeks, the firſt will be ended by ſix dayes and twenty hours, the ſecond by thirteen dayes and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours; the third by twenty dayes and twelve hours. Nor is that Periodical Moneth to be neglected, for that reaſon which forced <hi>Galen</hi>'s invention to forge the <hi>Medicinal</hi> Moneth, but is rather the more to be accepted of, becauſe it affords us a reaſon why the twentieth and one and twentieth dayes are numbred among the Critical ones. For though the twentieth more frequently judge, yet the one
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153522:62"/>and twentieth is not wholly to be rejected. And for this cauſe <hi>Archigenes</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> whom we find by the teſtimony of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>of Decretory dayes, chap.</hi> 2. very exact in the operations of Art, numbred the one and twentieth among the Critical dayes. But this is the reaſon why both of them are Critical dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both of them concur to compleat the third week, whoſe laſt day borrowes twelve hours from the twentieth, and as many from the one and twentieth. But yet <hi>Criſes</hi> more frequently happen on the twentieth, becauſe upon the determination of the acute diſeaſe, Nature as weary of a longer trouble, encounters the diſeaſe in the firſt dawning of the Critical day, and endevours a <hi>criſis.</hi> But this beginning of the Critical day is in the middle of the twentieth, as the end thereof falls in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or twelfth hour of the one and twentieth. It is alſo <hi>obſervable,</hi> that the motion of the Moon is ſometimes ſlower, ſometimes ſwifter, and according to the ſwiftneſs of it the <hi>criſis</hi> happens ſooner, but according to its ſlow progreſs the <hi>criſis</hi> appears later, and therefore a certain number of hours cannot be aſſigned, in which the <hi>criſis</hi> may happen, but in a wide conjecture the ſeventh, the fourteenth, and the twentieth dayes are to be noted. As <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeemed to ſignifie <hi>in</hi> 6 <hi>Epid.</hi> where to the number of the dayes he hath added that prepoſition <hi>about, viz.</hi> about the twentieth, about the fortieth, and ſo forth. Beſides, the <hi>criſis</hi> doth not alwayes begin and end the ſame day, but is ſometimes extended to more dayes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation begins on the twentieth, but the <hi>criſis</hi> ends on the one and twentieth: But the whole continuance of time in perturbation, conflict, and excretion, is uſually termed the time of the <hi>criſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides the principal cauſe, which is the motion of the Moon, we muſt acknowledge two other cauſes of the Critical dayes leſs principal,</hi> viz. <hi>the motion and diſpoſition of humors, as alſo the nature of the ſick party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although the virtue of the Moon be moſt available in conſtituting of Critical dayes, yet by it ſelf it is inſufficient, otherwiſe in all ſick perſons the ſame <hi>Criſes</hi> would happen in the ſame number of dayes; But the thing runs otherwiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſome are ſubject to a <hi>Criſis</hi> on the ſeventh, ſome on the fourteenth, ſome on other dayes, to ſome good, to ſome bad. There are therefore other cauſes to which this diverſity is to be attributed. For firſt the motion, and diſpoſition of humors is the cauſe that a <hi>Criſis</hi> ſometimes falls out ſooner, ſometimes later, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo on the intercident or indicative dayes; for the humors upon concoction performed ſooner, or later, and upon their acquiſition of a favourable or malignant quality, ſooner, or later excite nature: As alſo, if they are moved on this or that day from whence ariſe exacerbations of feavers, in which moſt uſually <hi>Criſes</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Acute diſeaſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are judged on the day of their exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Laſtly, The nature of the ſick body, which as before is ſaid, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe of the whole <hi>Criſis,</hi> or Critical excretion, and is alſo the leſs principal cauſe of the critical dayes, for as it is ſtrong, or infirm it concocts ſooner or ſlower the morbifick matter, and the quickneſs, or ſlowneſs of the <hi>Criſis</hi> depends upon ſlow or quick concoction, ſo when the morbifick matter is not concocted on the ſeventh day, the <hi>Criſis</hi> is deferred to the fourteenth, or the twentieth. For the Moon moves the humors every critical day, and excites nature to excretion; but this motion is fruſtrate, for nature leaves excretion unattempted, unleſs ſhe finds matter prepared and diſpoſed for evacuation, except this ſometimes happen by extreme irritation, by reaſon of the malignity of the matter, which nature ſomtimes, though it be yet crude, lays out the utmoſt of her ſtrength to expell: but this <hi>Criſis</hi> is unhappy, becauſe it tranſgreſſeth the ordinary laws of nature. And this is enough to be ſaid of the cauſes of <hi>Criſes</hi> and critical dayes.</p>

                  <p>THis definition or rather explication of the morbifick cauſe is <hi>moſt general,</hi> which could not be any other, to comprize all the cauſes, conſidered in Medicine: for all thoſe things which conferre any thing whatſoever to the generation of the diſeaſe, either by themſelves, or by accident, mediately, or immediately are called by their name of Cauſes; as alſo all thoſe things which are advantagious to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe either by conſervation, or augmentation, or by any other means, as ſhall hereafter appear in the differences.</p>

                  <p>The Philoſopher rallies all the cauſes of things under four heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Material, Efficient, and Final; to the ſeries of which all morbifick cauſes are to be referred. Yet here we cannot trace the four genus's of theſe cauſes: for that firſt the formal cauſe is nothing elſe, but the proper eſſence of every thing, but we have at large explained the nature and eſſence of diſeaſes before. Next there is no material cauſe in diſeaſes, for diſeaſe being an accident needs no matter, out of which it ſhould be produced, but in which it ſhould exſiſt, which is nothing elſe, but the ſubject thereof, or the parts of our body: As for the final cauſe, though the leſion of actions may be termed as it were ſuch, yet this is by accident, as it follows the generation of the diſeaſe, but diſeaſes by themſelves and properly have no final cauſe, as neither all thoſe things which are conſtituted in a kind of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; therefore the efficient cauſe remains onely conſiderable in this diſcourſe, which is here taken by the Philoſopher not only for that from which the effect is firſt produced, but in a wider ſignification, as appears by our deſcription, for all that which is in any manner conducible to the generation of the diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>SO cold water ſprinkled upon our body, by it ſelf and naturally cauſeth a chilneſs; but by accident, upon the denſation of the skin, and contraction of the vapors within, it heats.

                  </p>
                  <p>The term of <hi>external</hi> ſeems not very convenient, becauſe ſleep, waking, and the paſſions of the mind are comprehended under it, which yet ſeems to be contained among internal things; yet becauſe it hath found much acceptance with Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, therefore we alſo reject it not, averring thoſe cauſes to be external, becauſe many of them are outwardly applyed, as, the air, meat, drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the reſt, as ſleep, waking, and the paſſions of the mind, are ſo manifeſt, that they are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any diſpute for external poſitions; <hi>Celſus</hi> therefore calleth them <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> by a very appoſite term. Others call them procatarctick, precedent, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, becauſe from them the firſt original of diſeaſes flows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But of them ſome are neceſſary, ſome are unneceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The neceſſary are thoſe which do neceſſarily affect us, and inevitably light upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet though they neceſſarily affect us, they do not neceſſarily introduce diſeaſes, but they are neutrals, fluttering in an indifferency between health and diſeaſe; for by the orderly uſe of them health is preſerved, but by the abuſe, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs of them it is deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they are ſix;</hi> 1 <hi>Air,</hi> 2 <hi>Meat and drink,</hi> 3 <hi>Motion and reſt,</hi> 4 <hi>Excretions and Retentions,</hi> 5 <hi>Sleeping and Waking,</hi> 6 <hi>The Paſſions of the mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are vulgarly called the ſix not-natural things, becauſe by themſelves they are neither agreeable to, nor diſconſonant from the nature of mans body, but are made hurtful or uſeful according to the mode of well or bad uſing them. They are peculiarly handled in that part of Medicine which treateth of Dyet, therefore we omit the diſcourſe of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The unneceſſary are they which happen fortuitly, and not concurring to the ordinary uſe of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All fortuite things are comprehended under theſe, as the ſtrokes of ſwords, or ſtones, the bitings of wilde beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The internal cauſes are thoſe which lurk within our body imperceptible to ſenſe, and diſcoverable only by an artificial conjecture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:153522:64"/>
                  <p>So the humors, ſpirits, excrements, flatulency, vapors, particles of the parts themſelves, and whatſoever is contained in them, or agnate to them, are circled into the nature of internal morbifick cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they are either antecedent or concomitant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The antecedent cauſe is that which is before the concomitant, and moveth it, and by the mediation of it effects a diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in continuall feavers the antecedent cauſe is the matter fitted for putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the concomitant, which actually putrefies: So in ſwellings cauſed by humors, the flowing humor is accounted the antecedent cauſe, the flux the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Concomitant cauſe is that which immediately and by it ſelf produceth the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Examples of this are after propoſed in the explication of the antecedent. But it is obſervable, that external cauſes are ſometimes concomitant, as the ſword, which immediately makes the wound, and therefore all the cauſes are not ſeldome divided into procatarctick, antecedent, and concomitant, omitting the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of internal and external.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The concomitant cauſe is again ſimply concomitant, or containing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simply concomitant is that, which if it be, the diſeaſe is; but if it be taken away, the diſeaſe remains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſuppoſing the action wounding, the wound is ſuppoſed; but taking away the action, that remains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Continent cauſe is that which being ſuppoſed, a diſeaſe is ſuppoſed, and being taken away that follows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſuppoſing the ſtone, or ſome other matter cauſing obſtruction, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe obſtruction, which if we take away, obſtruction removes alſo. So taking away a ſixth finger, making an exceſs in number, the error depending on that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that all diſeaſes have not a containing cauſe, but ſome onely, but all the reſt have neceſſarily a concomitant cauſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus far of the Cauſes of Diſeaſes in their <hi>genus,</hi> it followes that we handle them in their <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Five cauſes of a hot intemperature are alleaged: <hi>1</hi> Motion, <hi>2</hi> Putridity, <hi>3</hi> The vicinity of an hot thing, <hi>4</hi> Conſtipation, <hi>5</hi> Meat and Drink over-hot; as <hi>Galen</hi> ch. <hi>2.</hi> Book <hi>2.</hi> of the Cauſes of Diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="motion">
                     <head>Firſt, Motion heats the body by attenuating and violently hurrying the ſpirits.</head>
                     <p>MOtion doth not onely heat things animate, but inanimate alſo, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 2 <hi>of Meteors, ch.</hi> 3. inanimate things by rarefaction, becauſe that diſpoſition is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to heat, by which it effected the laſt preparation of the matter, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of heat potentially out of it. But animals do more eaſily get heat by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only by reaſon of that attenuation, but alſo becauſe the ſpirits and heat which are actually in them, are diffuſed thorough the whole body, and thruſt out to the ſuperficies thereof. Whence if motion be immoderate, it produceth an hot intemperature. To motion are alſo referred anger, watching, and all other things, able to move the humors and ſpirts.</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:153522:64"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, putridity heats the body by external heat, which is alwayes introduced in its company.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Putridity is defined by <hi>Ariſtotle, The corruption of native heat in every humid body by external heat.</hi> But it is neceſſary that this heat ſhould be very intenſe, that it may corrupt the native heat; whence in our bodies it will eaſily produce a hot diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, The vicinity of hot things heats the body by a Phyſical and Mathematical contact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So by fire or Summer ſun the body is heated by a Phyſical contact, by things hot applyed, as plaiſters, baths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by a Mathematical contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, conſtipation cauſeth a hot diſtemper by accident, by reaſon of obſtructed tranſpiration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is chiefly produced by ſwiming in alluminous water, by the application of emplaſtick and obdurating medicines, and other things increaſing heat by <hi>antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaſis,</hi> while they hinder the diſſipation thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, hot aliments heat the body by producing in it hot humors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As, the uſe of onyons, garleek, ſpices, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſes of a cold diſtemper are ſix:</hi> 1 <hi>Vicinity of cold bodies.</hi> 2 <hi>The quality and quantity of things aſſumed.</hi> 3 <hi>Conſtipation.</hi> 4 <hi>Rarity.</hi> 5 <hi>Over-much idleneſs.</hi> 6 <hi>Immoderate motion. As</hi> Galen ch. 3. Book 2. of the Cauſes of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, the body is refrigerated by external cold, meeting with the concurrence of a fit diſpoſition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Patient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So in Winter a body is often congealed by over-much cold: So bathing in cold water cools the whole body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, the exceſs, defect, and incomplying quality of aliments, can induce a cold diſtemper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Exceſs of aliment chokes the native heat, whence ariſes a cold diſtemper; ſo an epile pſie or apoplexy is the reſult of frequent drunkenneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The defect of aliment cauſes the diſſipation of heat in the parts, as having not food ſufficient for its conſervation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatſoever is aſſumed naturally too cold, as lettice, poppy, mandrakes, and the like, do very much cool the body by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, much conſtipation chokes the heat, whence proceeds a cold diſtemper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Slight conſtipation cauſeth an hot diſtemper, by hindring the diſſipation of heat; but much &amp; immoderate conſtipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſeth a contrary affection by ſuffocating heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, rarity diſſipates and reſolves heat, whence by accident it induceth cold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, idleneſs refrigerates the body, for that the native heat languiſheth for want of exerciſe. Sixthly, the native heat is diſſipated by immoderate motion, whence by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it refrigerates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of a dry temperature the cauſes are two:</hi> 1 <hi>Alteration.</hi> 2 <hi>Reſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, thoſe things dry by alteration, which have ſtrength enough to exiccate the body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So drying aliments &amp; medicines, &amp; a dry conſtitution of the air, do dry the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, thoſe things dry the body by reſolution, which cauſe a greater diſſipation of the humidity of our body, than can be counterpoiſed by reſtauration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So violent exercitation, the embraces of over-heated air, immoderate watches, reſolves the humidity of the body. So humidity is diſſipated by the hindrance of due reparation, which is cauſed by care, and anxiety, hunger, or food affording ſmall nutriment, ſuch as is very excrementous and aſtringent, becauſe it hinders the diſtribution of nutritive humor thorough the members.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Humid intemperatures are aſcribed to two cauſes:</hi> 1 <hi>Alteration,</hi> 2 <hi>Retention of humid things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:153522:65"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, thoſe things introduce a moiſt intemperature by alteration, which are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in moiſtning the body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the immoderate uſe of moiſt meats, copious tipling of water, a moiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the air, a bathing in warm water, and ſuch like, the uſual product of which is a moiſt diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, a moiſt diſtemper is ſaid to be introduced by retention of things humid, when ſome cuſtomary evacuation is ſuppreſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongſt the uſual evacuations are numbred not thoſe onely which are ſenſibly made, but thoſe alſo which are made inſenſibly, <hi>viz.</hi> by inſenſible tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And theſe are the cauſes of ſimple diſtempers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the cauſes of compounded diſtempers may eaſily be gathered from thoſe before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> viz. <hi>by joyning all the cauſes which the two peccant qualities are able to produce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the immediate cauſes of compounded tempers are principally peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; and theſe diſtempers are like the peccant humor; for choler cauſeth the hot and dry, flegme the cold and moiſt, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But thoſe humors become copious in the parts two wayes:</hi> 1 <hi>By fluxion,</hi> 2 <hi>By congeſtion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fluxion is cauſed two wayes:</hi> viz. <hi>when either the humors are expelled by the miſſion of the parts, or when they are attracted by the reception of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In fluxion which is cauſed by expulſion two conditions are requiſite,</hi> viz. <hi>firſt, the ſtrength of the part expelling; ſecondly, the imbecility of the part receiving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the liver by its ſtrength expels preternatural humors to the groin, or the skin (parts naturally infirm) producing in them ſwellings, itch, and other affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In fluxion cauſed by attraction, two conditions principally concur,</hi> viz. <hi>the heat, or pain of the attractive part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Attraction is proper to heat, therefore the hot parts are prevalent in attraction: but being ſenſible of pain they ſeek help, therefore they attract the humors, and ſpirits to their reſcue, which after by reaſon of their copiouſneſs they cannot keep in good order, which is the cauſe of divers affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, by congeſtion the humors become copious in the parts, in default of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So when in ſome part the aliment is not well aſſimilated, or the expulſion of excrements generated in aſſimilation, then ſuperfluities abound in it by congeſtion.</p>

                  <p>For inſtance, when an infant ſtarting from the wombe, puts forth his foot, arm, or ſides, while by his own bulk, or the narrowneſs of the wombe, it endevours its <hi>exit</hi> too much, or is unskilfully handled by an ignorant Midwife.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After birth the ſhape of the parts is deformed by many external and internal cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>External cauſes miſhaping a man, are when the infant being yet tender is not conveniently entertained in ſwathings, or is raſhly cruſhed any other way: as alſo, if any member broken or diſlocated, fall not into the hands of a good Artiſt in Chirurgery; or if they being well reſtored by the error of the patient diſtorted to a relapſe; or diſordered by a fall, ſtroke, or too much motion and agitation.</p>
                  <p>But by internal cauſes the ſhape is unfaſhioned, when the humors are rallied copiouſly in the parts, as is evident in preternatural tumors, in the face of Lepers, in the belly of hydropical men, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtriction, obſtruction and dilatation, are produced by a multitude of cauſes, which coarctate, obſtruct or dilate the paſſages or cavities, which to number to a particularity is a task almoſt impoſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſperity and levity is produced by many cauſes internal or external.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For inſtance, bones wounded, broken, or eroded, looſe their natural laevity; the inner part of the <hi>aſpera arteria</hi> is unequal, and cauſeth an hoarſe and inharmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical voyce, being drench'd with too much humor, dry, deterſe, or ulcerated, which reaſon alſo will hold good in the reſt. But in parts naturally rough, and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, laevity is cauſed by viſcid and glutinous humors, adhering to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunicles, as in a <hi>Lieuteria;</hi> ſo alſo things wounding, and eroding by accident, when a skar is induced on a cured ulcer, by which that internal ſuperficies is more ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and leſſe fit to contain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude is increaſed in the body by too much plenty of blood and fat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude is increaſed in a part, either by affluxion of laudable blood, or vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors collected by fluxion or congeſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in ſome women the caule grows very fat, by reaſon of the plentiful affluxion of blood, and enlarges to ſuch a bulk, that by compreſſion of the orifice of the wombe it induces ſterility. So vicious humors cauſe various kinds of ſwellings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude in the whole body is diminiſhed for want of aliment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in a <hi>Pthiſis, Maraſmus,</hi> and notable leanneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude is diminiſhed in a part, when it doth not take in convenient aliment, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpoſe of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The number of the parts is increaſed in birth, or after birth. In birth by the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of ſeminal matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As when ſix fingers or three teſticles are generated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After birth, by vicious matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As appears in warts, or a <hi>pterygium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The number is diminiſhed in birth, by defect of matter; after birth by all thoſe things which are able to amputate or deſtroy any part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſituation of the parts is changed, either by default of them, or the parts containing them, or the ligaments connecting them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſituation of the parts is changed by default of the parts themſelves, by their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much craſſity or gravity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the caule or inteſtines being too craſs, or too fat, are by their owne weight
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153522:66"/>of overburdened to a rupture, or elſe they dilate the <hi>peritonaeum,</hi> and fall down into the <hi>ſcrotum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſituation is changed by default of the parts containing, when they being broken or looſened cannot duely execute their office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when the <hi>peritonaeum</hi> is by any means broken or looſened, it cannot keep the parts in it contained in their proper ſtation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſituation is changed by default of the ligaments, when they are too looſe or infirm; ſo that they cannot retain the parts to the connexed in their natural place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the wombe, the <hi>inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and other parts do uſually fall by too much extenſion, or the weakneſs of their ligaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The connexion of the parts is deſtroyed by many internal and external cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the joyntings peculiarly the connexion is changed by three cauſes:</hi> 1 <hi>By defect of an entertaining room,</hi> viz. <hi>an hollowneſs.</hi> 2 <hi>By defect of a bone to be entertained, 3 Of a ligament containing and making firm the articulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, there is a defect in the place entering, when either the cavity receiving is too broad or ſuperficiary, or when the ridges are taken away, or the brims hurt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, in the bone entertained there is a defect, when it is bigger or leſs than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, or any other way out of ſhape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, there is a defect in the ligaments, when they are too looſe or infirm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all theſe cauſes luxations are uſually produced; to which may be added violent and innordinate motions.</p>

                  </head>
                  <head type="sub">A Symptome is a preternatural affection following the Diſeaſe, as the effect of its cauſe, and not being able to ſubſiſt without it.</head>
                  <p>THIS term <hi>affection</hi> is here taken in a ſignification ſomewhat more large than in the definition of a diſeaſe; whereas not all ſymptomes have a permanency or poſition of parts in their ſubject, but moſt part of them have a poſitive eſſence in a tendency to being; for actions either whole, or not well hanging toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſiſt in the motion of the parts, and are perpetually in a tendency to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Excretion and retention is proper to them ſo long as they are in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, if we conſider them in the mood of their formality. But the ſimple or patible qualities are ſometimes fix'd and permanent. We alſo alleage, that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes follow the diſeaſe, becauſe (as we ſaid) they are by it effected; but the effect is the attendant of its cauſe, whence it alſo appears that it is different from its cauſe, for that the cauſe of diſeaſes precedes, but the ſymptome follows. But for the more clear underſtanding of the nature of ſymptomes, the ſucceeding Theorems are propoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every ſymptome depends mediately or immediately on a diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief ſymptome is injured action, immediately depending on a diſeaſe, which is able to produce another in excretions and retentions, and that to induce a change of qualities, which yet depend upon the diſeaſe as their true cauſe, ſome mediately, ſome immediately, as is before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſymptomes may arrogate to themſelves the honor of cauſes, never of diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So nutrition hurt is the cauſe of the conſumption of the parts, and leanneſs: So excrements impriſoned in the body, cauſe feavers, obſtructions, humors, and ſuch like; and ſo the ſymptomes become the cauſes of diſeaſes, but never preſume to take the nature of a diſeaſe, as being unable by themſelves to injure the actions. For though ſome diſeaſes be called ſymptomatical, becauſe they are conſequents of others; as a feaver, which follows a pleuriſie, or any other inflammation, which is in it ſelf a true diſeaſe, yet in reſpect of the diſeaſe on which it depends it is called a ſymptome. Yet certain it is, that thoſe diſeaſes are improperly termed ſymptomes, becauſe they follow other diſeaſes as ſymptomes, but yet they are not the immoderate production of them, but mediate by ſome true ſymptomes (for as by humor, or vapor) which are the after-cauſes of diſeaſes.</p>

                  <head type="sub">There are three kinds of Symptomes, action-hurt, default in excrements, and quality changed.</head>
                  <p>ACtion-hurt is the chief and principal ſymptome, which immediately followes the diſeaſe, and from which the reſt are generated and depend. Default in excretions follow the leſſon of natural actions, by which the aliments are ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, corrupted, or tainted with ſome evill quality; or laſtly, are naturalized to a contrariety infeſtious to the body: But by Excretions we here underſtand, not onely true excrements, but alſo all thoſe which preternaturally iſſue out of the body, as ſand, the excrements of the parts themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But quality changed follows the before-mentioned ſymptomes, and under it are contained all patible qualities perceptible by ſenſe, and inherent in the body it ſelf, or in any part thereof, as colours, ſmell, taſte, and the like, which in their proper place ſhall more at large be explained.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The differences of Action-hurt are taken either from the differences of laeſions, or from the diviſions of the actions themſelves.</hi>

                     <hi>The differences of laeſions cauſe a triple difference of hurt-action: <hi>1</hi> Action aboliſhed, <hi>2</hi> Dimiſhed, <hi>3</hi> Depraved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Action aboliſhed is that which is impoſſible by any means to be reſtored.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS ſight in blindneſs, and hearing in deafneſs, are ſaid to be be aboliſhed, becauſe they cannot by any means be exerciſed. Yet there is action called aboliſhed as to the judgement of the ſenſe, as motion and ſenſe in an apoplexy, and in a ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the wombe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Action diminiſhed, is that which is infirm, and ſcarce exerciſed, and requires more time for perfection, or never arrives to a juſt proportion thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the weak concoction of the ventricle, or function of any other part, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exerciſed, is ſaid to be diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Depraved action is ſo called, either when it is corrupted, or not exerciſed as it ought to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Action is termed corrupt when it changes its object into another quality, as when the ventricle changeth the aliment into nidorous juices, as porraceous choler, or matter, wholly putrid. It is not exerciſed as it ought to be, in cold palpitation, hiccough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe in theſe affections the parts are unduely agitated, or too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently provoked by a preternatural object.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:153522:67"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the differences of action, Action hurt is threefold;</hi> 1. <hi>Animal.</hi> 2. <hi>Vital.</hi> 3. <hi>Natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe branch out again into as many differences as in Phyſiology are propoſed of animal, vital, and natural actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The animal actions are in Phiſiology divided into Senſitive, Motive and Principal. The Senſitive actions are five, Sight, Hearing, Taſt, Smel and Touch. All theſe as before is declared are ſubject to abolition, deminution, and depravation. The Sight is aboliſhed in blindneſs, diminiſhed in obtuſion, and dulneſs, depraved in hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucination. The Hearing is aboliſhed in deafneſs, diminiſhed in ſlowneſs of hearing, depraved in the tinckling of the ears; and thus it is eaſie to conjecture of the ſymptomes of other Senſes. Motion is aboliſhed in the palſy, diminiſhed in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, depraved in convulſions, trembling, cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the principal actions, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination and memory are aboliſhed in a carus and apoplexy, diminiſhed in fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lethargy, depraved in phrenſy and madneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Vital actions conſiſt in the Pulſes, which alſo are frequently aboliſhed, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or depraved.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly the natural actions, concoction, retention, attraction, and expulſion are accompanied with as many ſymptomes. The Concoction of the ventricle is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in <hi>inconcoction,</hi> diminiſhed in <hi>ſlow concoction,</hi> and depraved in <hi>bad concoction.</hi> So we muſt judge of the other differences of actions, all which ſuffer under as many differences of laeſions, of which many are not yet particularized by proper terms.</p>

The vulgar anſwer is, that it is contained under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of depraved action, becauſe it is amiſt, and perverſly exerciſed, which is the condition of depraved action: but it is objected, that if this opinion hold, that diminiſhed action ſhould alſo be placed under depraved, ſince action increaſed and diminiſhed ſtand in a direct contrariety, and therefore ought to be placed under the ſame <hi>genus.</hi> It is anſwered, That in matter of diſeaſes and ſymptomes it is not a Phyſicians buſineſs to conſider the trifles of Logical contrarieties, but only thoſe diverſities by which our bodies are preternaturally affected: and ſo action increaſed ſtanding in a wide diſtance from action diminiſhed, as well in reſpect of the cauſe, as of the manner of operation, when as we ſaid it is amiſte and perverſly exerciſed, it is in right reaſon contained under depraved action, and diſtinguiſhed in the whole <hi>genus</hi> from action diminiſhed in a Medicinal conſideration.</p>

                     <p>Among the changed qualities we place, Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Dryneſs, which were before referred to the ſimilar diſeaſes, which knits a knot, difficult of reſolution, which we thus untye, by averring, that ſlight diſtempers which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a way to perfection, and have no permanence in the part, cannot be reckoned
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153522:68"/>among diſeaſes, but are rather termed ſymptomes, and changed qualities, which by the vicinity or ſympathy of ſome parts, a morbous diſtemper being raiſed, are generated and preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Next aſperity and laevity are here with the changed qualities, which were referred to organical diſeaſes. To this <hi>it is anſwered,</hi> that aſperity and laevity, if they be very remarkable, ſo that they manifeſtly injure the actions of thoſe parts, wherein they reſide, are true diſeaſes, but if they be ſo ſlight, that they are not at all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the actions, and yet are produced from a preternatural cauſe, as an humid or dry diſtemper, it is a convincing evidence that they are true ſymptomes.</p>

                     </gap> Symptome depends upon ſome diſeaſe, as its proper cauſe.</head>
                  <p>THIS is chiefly demonſtrated in hurt-action, which is the immediate effect of a diſeaſe, as appears by its definition. Beſides, it is undoubtedly true, that the changed qualities do proceed from the firſt qualities, which conſtitute the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, which when it conforms to nature, cannot produce qualities changed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, which it is evident do perpetually flow from the diſtemper. Laſtly, ſeeing there happens no default in the excrements, unleſs the concoctive, expulſive, or retentive faculties be vitiated, it is very certain that this proceeds perpetually from ſome diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But the cauſes of ſymptomes in their <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and the hiſtory of all diſeaſes are exactly propoſed in <hi>particular Pathology, chap.</hi> 7. We will here illuſtrate onely by ſome examples, for the better knowledge.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The animal actions are uſually hurt by various differences of diſtempers, organical diſeaſes, and ſolutions of the <hi>continuum.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SO by the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the brain in exceſſe the animall actions are aboliſhed; as appears in folly and forgetfulneſs, and by a more remiſs diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they are diminiſhed, as in fatuity and ſtupidity, as alſo they are depraved by an hot diſtemper, ſometimes ſimple, ſometimes in conjunction with ſiccity, as in a phrenſie and madneſs. Thoſe actions are alſo ſometimes offended by organical diſeaſes, as by obſtructions and various tumors, and by ſolutions of the <hi>continuum,</hi> as by notable wounds in the head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The vital actions conſiſting in the palſies are aboliſhed, depraved, or diminiſhed by an hot and cold diſtemper principally by obſtruction and ſolution of the</hi> continuum, <hi>according to the various intenſion or remiſſion of cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:153522:69"/>
                  <p>So in feavers the pulſe is depraved, aboliſhed in a ſyncope, and diminiſhed in a lipothymy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The private natural actions are hurt only by ſimilar diſeaſes, but the official by organical alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The private natural actions related to nutrition, <hi>viz.</hi> the attractive, retentive, and expulſive, are perfected by the temper onely, therefore diſtemper onely can hurt them; but the official want the various conformation of thoſe parts, by which they are exerciſed; they therefore are hurt by organical diſeaſes alſo. So the action of the ventricle, liver, or any other inſtrument, is ſometimes perverted by an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and other preternatural tumors; and hence the concoction is depraved or diminiſhed. So alſo official attraction is hurt, when by a carnous ſwelling, or any other tumor ariſing in the throat, the way is block'd up againſt food, or elſe the attraction of it to the ventricle is very difficult. Retention like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is hindred by the ſame cauſes, as alſo by the copiouſneſs of flatulency. And laſtly, expulſion is hindred by the narrowneſs and obſtruction of the paſſages, or alſo when it is too much provoked and accelerated by dilatation or vellication of the part.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The errors in Excrements depend perpetually upon diſeaſes, but moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the mediation of the detriments of actions: In this manner:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Too great a quantity of excrement depends either upon the weak retentive or expulſive faculty (of the part by which excretion is made) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſome vicious quality, or exceeding quantity of humor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> is cauſed by ſharp and bilious humors, as alſo by the overflowing of ſome humor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A vacuation alſo of the excrements too plentiful, is cauſed by defect in the part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, by reaſon of which it is diſabled to contain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This happens when the orifices of the veſſels are open or eroded by an internal or external cauſe, or onely debilitated, as appears in excretion of blood, cauſed by <hi>the anaſtomoſis, diabroſis,</hi> or <hi>diapeidiſis</hi> of the veins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The quantity of excrements is diminiſhed, either when they are ſparingly generated, or when the retentive faculty is too ſtrong, the expulſive too weak, or when the paſſages are narrow and obſtructed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The excrements are ſparingly generated either by paucity, craſſity or dryneſs of aliments; or by contrary vacuations, which do uſually hinder the cuſtomary ones, or by too much reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the whole body.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>The Symptomes which conſiſt in the firſt qualities, are cauſed by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of neighbouring or ſympathizing parts, as is ſaid.</hi>

                     <hi>But thoſe which are related to the ſecond qualities, depend upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vitioſity of humors, or diſtemper of the parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO hardneſs is produced by dryneſs, tenſion, and congelation; ſoftneſs by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, as to the third qualities theſe are the cauſes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Colour is changed in the part, either by diſtemper, or by ſome humor lodged under its ſuperficies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So by a hot diſtemper the parts are red, by a cold one pale; ſo Choler diffuſed thorough the body cauſeth the yellow colour of men jaundiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vitiated ſmels ariſe from the putridity of the humors, or of the parts: Strange taſts by the excrements touching upon the tongue: Preternatural ſounds, by flatulency incloſed in ſome part, according to the various agitation thereof, the narrowneſs or largeneſs of the parts, and ſtrength or weakneſs of the elevating heat.</hi>

Secondly, he muſt make a diligent ſearch, whether the cure be not deſperate, and the diſeaſe incurable; that hence we may gather, that remedies fit for the acquiſition of health are to be applyed, if our Art upon ſerious inſpection promiſe a recovery; or if the prevalent diſeaſe delude our skill to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; forthwith to abſtain from adminiſtring any thing, leſt thoſe applications which have procured health to any, ſhould be undervalued to a diſeſteem.</p>

                  <p>ON healthy Signes we ſhall not long inſiſt, becauſe a ſtate of ſalubrity is eaſily known by the good temper of the body, the due conformation and union of the parts, and by the reſult thereof, the integrity of all actions; unhealthy Signes alſo are clear enough by the contrariety. But a neutrality of diſpoſition, like a <hi>medium</hi> interceding between ſalubrity and inſalubrity, will eaſily be evident upon knowledge of the extremes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But we muſt chiefly apply this diſcourſe to unhealthy Signes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And they are divided into Pathognomonical,</hi> viz. <hi>ſignifying paſſion, or conventional and concomitants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Pathognomonical, or thoſe that ſignifie paſſion, are they which perpetually aſſociate themſelves with a diſeaſe, entring with it, und departing with it, being diminiſhed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed according to the magnitude of the diſeaſe, and follow the proper eſſence of the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Pleuriſie, a pungitive pain of the ſide, difficulty of ſpiration, a rough bloody ſpittle, and an aſſiduous feaver, are called Pathognomonical ſignes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Conventional or concomitants are thoſe which do not neceſſarily cohere to diſeaſes, nor are ſignes of their eſſence, but of other accidental contingencies, as the magnitude, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or event of diſeaſes.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THat we may draw forth all Medical ſigns by the clue of an eaſy method, we muſt lay down ſome general heads, to which all the ſigns of any thing propoſed may be ſummoned in, and from whence they may again be artificially deduced.</p>
                  <p>Whereas therefore the eſſence and nature of every thing being any way enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, diſcovers to us, not onely what the thing is in it ſelf, but many other things alſo belonging to it, the firſt <hi>genus</hi> of ſignes ſhall be taken from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing in which we act. Next, ſeeing there are two pathes which guide us to the knowledge of any thing, one by ſomewhat preceding, that is the cauſe, and the other by ſomewhat ſucceeding, and that is the effect, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we propoſe two other <hi>genus</hi> of ſigns, one derived from the cauſes; the other from the effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are then three general heads of ſigns,</hi> viz. <hi>The Eſſence, Cauſes, and Effects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eſſence here is ſtretched to a large and Medical ſenſe, comprehending not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the form of the thing it ſelf, but alſo the <hi>genus,</hi> differences, parts, and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whether eſſentiall or accidental.</p>
                  <p>Under the term of Cauſes are touched all thoſe kinds of Cauſes, which are in Phyſick conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>The term <hi>effects</hi> includes a variety, conformable to the variety of cauſes.</p>
                  <p>All which heads of ſigns ſhall be by parcells anatomized in the particular inquiry into ſigns, as their uſe ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt here obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that ſigns cannot be deduced from all the heads, to inſtruct us in every particular thing. For the eſſence of a thing doth not ſeldome involve it ſelf in a mantle of obſcurity, and lies imperceptible to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions: and the cauſes ſometimes afford us no exact indication, other times the effects are confuſed. But by the propoſed heads of ſignes, ſome footſteps alwayes diſcoverable, by which if we track the thing, Medicine will according to her ability evidently demonſtrate it: ſo that ſometimes we derive neceſſary ſigns from the effects alone, ſometimes from the cauſes, ſometimes from the eſſence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from two together, and laſtly, ſometimes from all, which exercitation it ſelf will eaſily diſcover.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That moſt commonly we deſcry more and more infallible ſigns from the effects, then from the two other heads.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That of the propoſed ſigns as to indication, ſome are of more, ſome of leſſe efficacy, but yet by rallying up all, we draw a concluſive demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing which we enquire after.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That we muſt perfectly underſtand the nature, cauſes, and effects of all thoſe things which are in our body, or contingent to it, that we may not erre in deducing ſigns from the propoſed head. And we muſt be ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the precepts of Phyſiology and Pathology, that we may not here be deſtitute to ſhew them as often as occaſion of uſe ſhall require.

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the ſigns of the Affected part.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving duly enquired into the natural, we come now to ſearch out the preternatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body. Firſt then we will make a diligent inſpection, for the better diſcovery of the ſigns of the part affected: Next the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the affection poſſeſſing that part, and laſtly the cauſes on which it depends. The ſigns of the part affected may be derived from three heads, the Eſſence, the Cauſes, and the Effects; a Catalogue of which is propoſed in the Table marked with the letter, <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore according to that Series the affected part is diſcovered by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eſſence. Firſt quality.</hi> By the Temper of the part; for if we perceive it hot, moiſt, or dry in exceſſe, we ſhall judge it to be preternaturally affected.</p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:153522:75"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second.</hi> By hardneſs and ſoftneſs, if for inſtance, in Hypochondriacks we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hardneſs and retinency, we ſhall judge the parts ſubjected, the liver, or milt to be obſtructed, or inflamed: ſo too much ſoftneſs in any part is a ſign that the part is affected with ſome tumid diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnitude increaſed.</hi> A preternatural ſwelling, whether external, perceptible to the ſight, or internal, ſenſible to the touch, ſuch as the tumors of the ventricle, liver, milt, bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diminiſhed.</hi> A great conſumption and atrophy of the parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Situation.</hi> The ſituation of the part, which in this caſe is very conſiderable; for if we know by anatomical inſpection, what place is proper to every part in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we ſhall eaſily conjecture by the humor, diſtemper, or ſome other ſenſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection poſſeſſing that place, that that part is diſeaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Figure.</hi> The figure mutually diſtinguiſheth the parts ſituated in the ſame place, ſo a tumor in the right Hypochondrium ſhaped like the Moon, ſhews that the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chey part of the liver is affected; but being of a long figure, and more external, it evidenceth to us, that the ſtraight muſcles of the abdomen are affected.</p>
                  <div n="external" type="causes">
                     <head>External Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>External Cauſes alſo diſcover ſomething; for inſtance, if any one hath taken Cantharides, and conjecture that his bladder is affected, becauſe they have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vertue to alter the bladder, if any one be affected after converſe in the Sun, we judge that his head akes, becauſe the ſun doth uſually affect that part rather than any of the reſt; if the affection be produced by the immoderate uſe of venery, we ſay the ſpiritous ſubſtance, and nervous parts are ill, becauſe venery is an enemy to theſe parts.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="internal" type="causes">
                     <head>Internal cauſes.</head>
                     <p>We may number the affections themſelves among external cauſes; as where any one is troubled with a Tertian, this ſpeaks the liver affected; a Quotidian, the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle; a Quartan, the milt, becauſe theſe parts are the randezvouz of their cauſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That when we in practiſe ſearch for the part affected, we muſt not trace it by its eſſence and cauſes, but from its actions, excrements, and changed qualities, the ſignes are firſt to be deduced, and after from the eſſence and cauſes thereof.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pain pungitive, tenſive.</hi> A pungitive pain ſhews the membrane affected chiefly by ſharp and eroding matter, but a tenſive pain is often cauſed in the membranes by flatulency, and in the veins by over-repletion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gravative.</hi> A gravative pain ſignifies the <hi>parenchyma</hi> of any of the bowels to be affected, for all <hi>parenchyma's</hi> have a dull ſenſe. So when the ſtone preſſes the the ſubſtance of the reins, it cauſes a gravative pain, but when it crowns the head of the ureter, a pungitive. So likewiſe in the pleuriſie, when the matter ſeiſeth on rib-ſurrounding membrane, it raiſeth a pungitive pain; but when it makes a tranſition to the lungs, the pain is changed to gravative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pulſatory.</hi> The pulſatory pain ſhews an artery or ſome adjacent part to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; therefore in all the inflammation of the parts wherein the artery is lodged there is cauſed a pungitive pain.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the eſſence of the part.</hi> A cartilaginous ſubſtance expelled by cough, ſpeaks an affection in the <hi>aſpera arteria,</hi> or the concavities of the lungs; but a minute part of fungous fleſh excreted, ſhews the lungs themſelves to be affected, but a craſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance proceeds from craſs parts.</p>

                        <hi>Naturally contained.</hi> If meat, or urine, or dregs be expelled by a wound, we know that the ventricle, bladder, or inteſtines are wounded.</p>

                        <hi>Preternaturally contained.</hi> If ſmall ſtones or ſand be excreted by urine, the reins or the bladder are affected. Maw-worms expelled by the mouth or the gut, ſhew the inteſtines affected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quality of excrements.</hi> Air too hot ſent forth by expiration, diſcovers the heart or lungs to be hot; but too cold, ſhews the heart to be much refrigerated, and next neighbour to death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, ſecond, third.</hi> The blood too hot, too thin, and too yellow, and iſſuing as it were by leaps, ſhews an artery wounded.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Taſte.</hi> Acid belching ſhews the ventricle to be repleniſhed with crudities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quantity.</hi> If a great quantity of blood be expelled in coughing, the veſſels of the lungs are affected, thoſe which are in the <hi>aſpera arteria</hi> being too narrow for a plentiful effuſion of blood. The excretion of blood in urine, if it be not much, may be conjectured to proceed from the bladder; if much, from the reins, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour parts, where it is more copious.</p>

                        <hi>Order.</hi> If white corruption uſher out urine, there is an ulcer in the yard it ſelf; if it iſſue after urine, there is one in the bladder or reins. In a <hi>dyſenteria,</hi> if ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or pure blood flow out before the feculency, it is credible that the <hi>inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum</hi> is rather ulcerated than the reſt: but if after it, or much confuſed with it, it ſhews the ſuperiour or middle inteſtines to be affected.</p>

A laſting red in the cheeks, and of a deep grain, ſhews an inflammation in the lungs.</p>

<note place="margin">Vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> So the hand communicates a ſenſe of its evils to the arm, the bones to the adjacent fleſh, the ventricle to the liver, the pleura to the lungs, the lungs to the heart, and ſo round.</p>
                     <p>Parts placed under the ſame genus,

<note place="margin">Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that which hath greater ſymptomes is the primarily affected part, but the reſt by conſent.</p>
                     <p>Of many parts together affected, that is firſt diſeaſed, in which the ſymptomes firſt appeared. So when the ventricle is diſeaſed, if a pain of the head afterwards ariſe, this pain is ſymptomatical.</p>
                     <p>In the exacerbation of affections, that part is primarily diſeaſed, in which the exacerbations of the ſymptomes begin.</p>
                     <p>Idiopathetical affections are continual without any intermiſſion; but ſympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal admit uſually of a reſpit: ſo deliration cauſed by a feaver ordinarily ceaſeth upon the mitigation thereof, but being produced by the inflammation of the brain, it continues impatient of any reſtraint or mitigation.</p>

                  <p>THe ſignes diſcovering the ſpecies of affections, are almoſt of like learning with the ſignes of the part affected: but for clearer inſtruction ſake, we will handle them ſeverally, to avoid confuſion in that Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſignes therefore may be taken from three heads, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Eſſence of the diſeaſe it ſelf, from the cauſes producing it, and the effects thereof, or the ſymptomes flowing from it.</p>
                  <p>All which are orderly ſet forth in the following Table.</p>
                  <p>To this the Table noted with the Letter <hi>D</hi> is related.</p>
                  <p>But the ſeries of them is ſhortly demonſtrated in the following theorems.</p>

                     <p>The Eſſence of a diſeaſe is nothing elſe but the diſeaſe it ſelf; and therefore if our ſenſes will ſufficiently diſcover to us a diſtemper reſiding in any part, or ſome ſpecies of an organical diſeaſe, or the ſolution of the continuum, we ſhall not need any other ſignes to evidence it.</p>

                        <hi>Aliments and medicaments.</hi> Uſe of aliments and medicines of force to bind the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paſſages and cavities, breed a ſuſpicion that the diſeaſe was produced in aſtriction.</p>
                     <p>Incraſſating aliments and medicines do uſually generate many obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>Aliments and medicines very detergent do uſually produce aſperities in the tongue, oeſophagus, aſpera arteria, ventricle, and inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>Aliments fat and oleaginous generate levity in the inteſtines, and Lienteria's.</p>
                     <p>Medicines ſharp and eroding erode and exulcerate the internal parts.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> is often exaſperated or levigated by fluxions; therefore if that be affected, we may conjecture of aſperity or levity. Worms are commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the inteſtines, therefore upon an affection of the inteſtines we may call them in queſtion.</p>

                     <p>They who have a cold ventricle and hot reines, do uſually harbour ſtones in their reines, becauſe flegme generated in a cold ventricle, is by the heat of the reines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated, and converted into a ſtone.</p>

                  <p>A Phyſician who undertakes the cures of diſeaſes, is not ſufficiently furniſhed for it by the bare knowledge of their eſſential differences by their proper ſignes; for the accidental differences alſo are to be diligently inquired after, that we may paſs a certain judgement of them. We will therefore propoſe ſignes of the chiefeſt of them; <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe which are of near neceſſity to the practiſe of the Art; in reſpect of which every diſeaſe is called great or ſmall, gentle or malignant, acute or ſlow, and ſo forth. That diſeaſe is termed great, which is very intenſe, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our body with much violence. The ſignes of which are taken from the three heads aforeſaid; for we judge that diſeaſe great, which being great in its Eſſence, was produced by great and intenſe cauſes, and hath great and vehement ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes; all which for clearer inſtruction are in order to be handled, as is deſcribed in the following Table noted with the Letter <hi>E.</hi>

                        <hi>External.</hi> Whatſoever external Cauſes are very prevalent in affecting our body, do uſually produce and diſcover great diſeaſes. So long and violent exerciſe uſed in a very hot air, doth excite a great Feaver.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153522:81"/>either choler copious, ſharp, or putrified, are ſignes of a great diſeaſe.</p>

So a wound, though of it ſelf inconſiderable, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Heart, Liver, Lungs, or other the like parts, is counted great in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the part affected, as alſo becauſe it produceth great ſymptomes.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the ſignes of morbifick cauſes; and firſt, Of the ſignes of preternatural choler.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>DIſeaſes are moſt generally the ſpawn of various humours unconformable to nature: but thoſe humours do uſually breed diſeaſes, which are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the whole, or in any part of the body; and ſo if we do accurately know this factious humor, we ſhall eaſily arrive to the cauſe of the diſeaſe. We muſt therefore recall the ſignes of theſe domineering humors from the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Section; and becauſe the humors there fall under our conſideration, as they are conſtituted in their natural ſtate, we therefore propoſed onely four firſt differences of humors: but now ſome others offer themſelves, which are wholly preternatural; theſe we ſhall in ſhort propoſe, neither will it be impertinent to enquire after ſome other cauſes of diſeaſes produced by humors, leſt this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſhould be any way defective.</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore with choler; we termed that natural, which was died with yellow, or pale, though it be often diſobedient to nature, and produceth many diſeaſes: yet it always preſents the ſame ſignes, if to that which is preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſomewhat putredinous, we adde this onely, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is moved every third day, as manifeſtly appears in the paroxyſmes of a Tertian Feaver.</p>
                  <p>But there are other ſpecies of choler which are perpetually preternatural, and as often as they viſit the body, they uſually produce diſeaſes: and they are vitelline, porraceous, erguinous, glaſteous, and black.</p>
                  <p>The vitelline owes its production to the yellow, with the midwifery of preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat, which by diſſipating the thinner parts incraſſates that, ſo that in conſiſtence and colour it diſſembles the yolk of an egge.</p>
                  <p>This is not diſcovered by any other ſignes then the yellow, except onely that the colour of the excrements do diſſemble that yolk colour, or that that yolk mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in diſeaſes expelled by vomit or ſeceſs.</p>
                  <p>Porraceous, eruginous, and glaſteous are generated two ways, one by depraved aliments, and of a vicious juyce, ſuch are, Onyons, Leeks, Watercreſſes, and the like: The other by vitelline choler parched by vehement heat; by virtue of which it is painted in various colours, according to the various degrees of exuſtion; for the porraceous is generated by leſs aduſtion, the eruginous by greater, the glaſteous by more intenſe; for as the colour more emulates black, it argues the greater aduſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes therefore of theſe ſpecies of choler will be all thoſe which diſcover yellow choler, and much more intenſe, and beſides them theſe two chiefly; <hi>viz.</hi> long uſe of the aforementioned bad aliments, and excretions infected with thoſe colours.</p>
                  <p>Black choler is produced from the foregoing ſpecies of choler, by a more ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exuſtion: It is known by the mentioned cauſes parching and burning the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and eſpecially by the effects. For when it is expelled in excretion, it is known by its black colour, and inſufferable acrimony; it exulcerates the parts by which it paſſes, and being diffuſed on the earth, it ferments it.</p>
                  <p>Some accidents alſo are fathered upon it as the iſſues thereof, as cancrous tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, malignant ſcabs, noiſome ulcers, and the like; black choler is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153522:83"/>the product of putrified melancholy, but it is ſomewhat more mild then the former, producing the ſame, but leſs vehement ſymptomes.</p>

                     <p>Blood varies into no ſpecies but when it deviates from a natural condition, and is too much altered by heat, and ſo changed into divers ſpecies of melancholy; ſo alſo ſcorched or putrified melancholy degenerates into black choler; all which need no further ſcrutiny.</p>

                  <p>NAtural flegme is uſually called ſweet, or inſipid, yet from this exceeding in quantity, motion, or any other manner tranſgreſſing the bounds chalk't out by nature, many affections are generated.</p>
                  <p>Some of the ſpecies of it are perpetually preternatural, and thoſe are ſalt, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous, gypſeous.</p>
                  <p>Salt flegme is produced two ways according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his <hi>book of the differences of Feavers, Chap.</hi> 6. one out of putrefaction, the other by the ſalt ſerous humidity. But it is known by theſe ſignes, <hi>viz.</hi> by long uſe of ſalt diet, great thirſt, a Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria, with pituitous excrements, noiſom ſcabs, much itching, and chiefly by a ſalt raſte cauſed by a Catarrhe flowing into the mouth.</p>
                  <p>But the vitreous flegme is onely gathered in the inteſtines, and by reaſon of its intenſe coldneſs it is accounted very biting, ſo that it often produceth colick pains, which are by their mark diſtinguiſhed from them which are produced by flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe vitreous flegme generates fixt pain, and perferating like an awgre; but wandring and unſetled pains are generated by flatulencies.</p>
                  <p>Gypſeous, laſtly, is that flegme which is indurated almoſt to ſtone, and appears in the gravel, and nodoſities of gouty perſons, or is alſo ſometimes expelled by main force from the lungs like hail.</p>

So we know a Feaver to be beginning, when we perceive the heat diffuſed through the whole body to run in the ſame courſe it begun in, without any remarkable increaſe to higher inflammations. But to be then in augmentation, when the heat doth evidently grow more intenſe. And we know it to be then in ſtation, when the heat remits not any of that vehemency which was left at its higheſt degree; and laſtly to decline, when the hot diſtemper is in a way of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation.</p>

                  <div type="essence">
                     <head>The Eſſence.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hot diſeaſes are always of leſs continuance, if they have not contracted an habit; but cold ones longer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In diſeaſes which are ſupplied by acceſsions, the longer they are, they foretel the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the diſeaſe, the ſhorter they are, the ſhortneſs thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe acceſsions of diſeaſes which are ſoon perfected, ſignifie the ſpeedy expiration of the diſeaſe, according to</hi> Galen, Book 3. of Criſes, chap. 4. <hi>becauſe that vehement motion is the motion of an approching Criſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe acceſsions which like abortives come before their time an hour or two, ſignifie that the diſeaſe prepares for a ſpeedy departure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this anticipation is cauſed by the tenuity and mobility of the matter; yet we muſt note, that this anticipation, that it may ſignifie the brevity of a diſeaſe, muſt not be orderly, <hi>viz.</hi> to anticipate every day in the ſame ſpace of time, <hi>viz.</hi> one or two hours, for this order ſignifies the ſtability of the diſeaſe, and the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the morbifick matter. But the time of anticipations muſt be unequal, that by it the infirmity of the matter may appear, and that it is no uneaſie task for nature to be victorious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acceſsions returning ſlowly are ſignes of the diuturnity of the diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For hence it is evident that the morbifick matter is incraſſated to a contumacy: But yet this is ſometimes cauſed by the diminution of the ſame matter, when it is by degrees conſumed; which is eaſily perceptible by the remiſſion of ſymptomes, and the leſs troubleſom toleration of the ſick perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of thoſe who have acceſsions, what ever hour the Feaver departs, if it on the next day return on the ſame, difficult iudgement will be paſſed.</hi> Aph. 30. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>For when paroxyſmes do conſtantly obſerve the ſame returns, they ſignifie the firmneſs and ſtability of the matter, that it cannot be maſtered but by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict: becauſe order in all things denotes a fixtneſs, and power of cauſes, and ſo a difficult ſolution. So we are inſtructed by daily experience, that the paroxyſmes of quartan Feavers do moſt commonly return on the ſame hours, for that they are eſtabliſhed upon the foundation of a firm and ſtrong cauſe, whence alſo proceeds their contumacy and diuturnity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A paroxyſme alſo implies a difficulty, not onely if it always happen the ſame hour, but alſo if it anticipate or retard on even hours continually, and in the ſame proportion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As if a paroxyſme happen this day at one, the next at two, the third day at three of the clock: for in theſe there is order no leſs then in the precedent, which order per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually depends upon the fixtneſs and ſtubbornneſs of the matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe diſeaſes whoſe exacerbations return every third day, are ſhorter then thoſe which return every day; but thoſe are the longeſt which have recourſe every fourth day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a tertian Feaver, becauſe generated by choler, <hi>viz.</hi> thinner humor, is more eaſily diſſolved. But a quotidian is generated by flegme, which in reſpect of its craſſity and ſtubbornneſs is related as a medium to choler and melancholy. But though double tertians have daily paroxyſmes, yet by reaſon of the copiouſneſs of the matter, which much more abounds in them then in a ſimple tertian, they are uſually longer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe diſeaſes which have their paroxyſmes about noone, are ſhorter then thoſe which have them in the morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The longeſt of all are thoſe which have their exacerbations about evening, or in the night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the four humors uſe to be moved in the four parts of the day, <hi>viz.</hi> the blood in the morning, the choler at noon, the melancholy about evening, the flegme in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153522:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>the night. Whereas therefore the hour of exacerbation in continual Feavers, ſhews the predominancy of the humor, the ſame alſo may denote to us the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or brevity of the diſeaſe, which depends upon the nature of the humor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe diſeaſes whoſe ſolution is cauſed by excretion, are ſooner finiſhed then when it is cauſed by abſceſsion.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>According to the legitimate conſtitution of diſeaſes, the beginning of a diſeaſe is equal to the two ſubſequent times, but the beginning of augmentation is compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from that day in which the ſignes of concoction manifeſtly begin to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Of this event many examples are found in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as the 1. <hi>Epid. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 3. where he ſaith that one was judged on the ſeventeenth day, who had manifeſt ſignes of coction on the ninth, and <hi>book</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.

And <hi>Epiphanius Ferdinandes</hi> reports that many examples of this thing fell within the compaſs of his experience, <hi>hiſt.</hi> 86.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In diſeaſes in which coctions appear in the excrements from the beginning, they are ſignes of brevity, but when they are ſlow in coming forth, they ſignifie longitude.</hi>

                           <hi>Thoſe diſeaſes in which the excrements ſuffer ſome grand change, and much increaſe of coction, are accounted ſhorter; but long, if they be ſmall, and made by degrees.</hi>

                           <hi>All thoſe diſeaſes whoſe ſolution is by abſceſsion, are longer; by excretion, ſhorter.</hi>

                           <hi>Excretions driven out through convenient places, and fit for the expurgation of the parts, cauſe a ſhort diſeaſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So the head is purged by the noſtrils and palate; the inferiour parts of the belly by the guts and bladder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Parts are more eaſily purged by direct paſſages, and effect a ſhorter diſeaſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So the inflammation of the liver is eaſily allayed by iſſuing of blood through the right noſtril, but not through the left.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Excretions made through larger paſſages ſooner diſpatch a diſeaſe then thoſe made through narrower.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So the ſolution of the affections of the head is more ſpeedily cauſed by the palate and noſtrils, then by the ears. So feavers are ſooner ended by help of the belly then of the bladder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Excretions in acute diſeaſes on the critical day ſhew the ſhortneſs of a diſeaſe; but on another day, the continuance thereof.</hi>

                           <hi>Bubbles inflated on the ſurface of urine, ſignify a renal, and long diſeaſe. Aph.</hi> 34. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>For bubbles, as <hi>Galen in his comm.</hi> a verrs, are cauſed when the humor is diſtended by a flatuous ſpirit: and this contingency is more frequent when the humor is any thing tenacious; for then the bubbles themſelves are firme, and difficultly ſoluble. When therefore flatuous ſpirits are conveyed forth with the urine, it ſhewes the reines to be troubled with a cold affection, which muſters up the flatuous ſpirits, and ſo cauſes a long ſickneſs. For all cold things are difficultly ſoluble, and hardly admit of coction, and ſo are of long continuance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When the ſediments of the urine of men feaveriſh reſemble courſe meal, they portend a long ſickneſs. Aph.</hi> 31. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>For they ſignify that a feaver is cauſed by thick humors, which require much time for concoction and edomation. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 3. one who lay ſick in <hi>Dealces</hi> garden of a great feaver, voided thin urine, having a ſmall enaeorema like courſe meal, and was judged the fortieth day. But this opinion is to be taken in this ſenſe, that ſuch urine ſhould ſignify the longitude of the diſeaſe, if it be probable that the ſick perſon may eſcape it: for it is ſometimes deadly, and by it many are ſnacht away with death, before any longer protraction of ſickneſs, as may be ſeen in <hi>Hipp.</hi> book. 1. <hi>Epid. aegr.</hi> 2. where <hi>Silenus</hi> who dwelled in <hi>Platamon,</hi>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:153522:87"/>was neighbour to the ſons of <hi>Euacles,</hi> by wearineſs, and drinking, and unſeaſonable exercitations, was taken with a great feaver, on the tenth day he expelled by urine copiouſly ſomething thick, ſeparating, ſubſiding, farinacious matter; his extreme parts were cold; on the eleventh day he dyed. We muſt therefore affirm with <hi>Galen,</hi> that ſuch like ſediment ſignifies either death, or continuance of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt qualities. <hi>When mutations run through the whole body, if the body be refrigerated, or again heated; or if one heat ſpring out of another, this ſignifies the duration of a diſeaſe. Aph.</hi> 40. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>For by theſe viciſſitudes it appears that various humors abound in the body, which cauſe various diſpoſitions. But nature wants much time to unburden it ſelf of many diſpoſitions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cold ſweats ſignify with an acute feaver death, with a more gentle one longitude of the diſeaſe. Aph.</hi> 37. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>For cold ſweats, as <hi>Galen in his comm.</hi> affirmes, proceed from ſome cold part, and cold humor; but they properly coming from the skin it ſelf, it is conſequent, that the skin ſhould in cold ſweats be refrigerated, and contain in it, or the parts ſubjected to it, cold humors. But when putrefaction of acute feavrs reſides in the bigger veſſels, it ſometimes happens that a great inflammation being in the inner parts, it preyes upon the native heat ſeated in the skin and the parts under it: and ſo when thoſe are together with the humors in them contained, refrigerated, it is not to be admired if they infrigidate the ſweats conveyed through them, though cauſed by very frequent humors impriſoned within. Cold ſweat then in acute feavers is a ſigne of death, becauſe it ſhewes that the native heat is too weake to lord it over theſe cold humors, and muſt therefore ſubmit to their pleaſure. But in more gentle feavers it ſignifies longitude, becauſe by reaſon of the exiguity thereof, it doth not ſo enervate the ſtrength, as to lay it naked to the invaſion of death; yet plenty of cold humors cannot under a long ſpace be concocted and ſubdued.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond. <hi>A very great extenuation of the whole body ſignifies a long diſeaſe.</hi>

                     <p>That is called a ſtrong Apoplexy, which introduceth a total privation of ſence and motion, together with a great laeſion of reſpiration: But a ſlight one is that in which there is no ſuch loſs of ſence and motion, or ſo violent an injury of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>In a ſtrong one the brain is ſo oppreſſed, that it cannot by any means free it ſelf from it; nor in a ſlight one neither, without much ſtruggling: ſo that alwaies if a ſolution is made, it degenerates into the Palſie, by reaſon of the weakneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unable any longer to expel the morbifick matter.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Tetanus, according to <hi>Galen in his comm.</hi> is a diſeaſe compounded of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſthotonus and an opiſthotonus, in which the body is ſo ſtiffe and unmoveable, that the breaſt alone can hardly be moved. It being therefore ſuch a violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it kills a man in the firſt quaternion, which if he eſcapes, it is a ſigne that the fury of the diſeaſe is remitted, otherwiſe it were intolerable.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe the temper of the liver being vehemently injured, is irreparable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All Feavers continual, and burning, as alſo the inflammations of internal parts, as Phrenſies, Quinſies, Pleuriſies, peripneumonies, hepatitides, and the like, are naturally dangerow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet they are not wholly mortal, but according to the various condition of the ſick perſon, they end ſometimes in health, ſometimes in death. Nor can a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian under pain of convincible ignorance, give ſentence of health or death on the beginnings of theſe affections, but the critical dayes are to be expected, which do commodiouſly diſcover unto us whether the diſeaſe incline to death or health.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Upon ceſſation of a Feaver into a dangerous diſeaſe without any evident cauſe, death not health is to be expected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whatever Feavers not intermitting on the third day grow ſtronger, are more dangerous. But thoſe which pauſe ſometimes, ſignifie no danger.</hi> Aph. 43. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>Continual Feavers either alwaies keep one ſtation, or are increaſed or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Thoſe which are increaſed and exacerbated, are worſe then thoſe which are not exacerbated, becauſe the evil in exacerbation is made much worſe, and more troubleſome to the ſick perſon. But they are exacerbated either every day, or every third day. But thoſe which are exacerbated every third day are more dangerous, for that they are cauſed by bilious and ſo more hot juyces, to which it is proper to be moved every third day. Of this kind are burning Feavers, and ſemitertians, which are uſually moſt dangerous.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe Feavers which intermit are not dangerous, becauſe as <hi>Galen in his comm.</hi> aſſerts, they proceed not from any inflammation, nor malignant putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for neither of theſe acquieſceth without a Feaver. Yet it is known by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153522:89"/>at leaſt in theſe regions, that intermitting tertians have been fraught with much malignity, which in a third or fourth paroxyſme did kill the ſick parties. We muſt ſay therefore that this opinion is of them which do moſt commonly but not perpetually happen; or we may anſwer to the defenſive argument of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> that theſe intermitting tertians have no perfect apyrexy, and there alwaies lies hid ſome obſcure ſparkles of a Feaver raked up in the embers of intermiſſion.</p>

                     <p>For the heart and lungs being augmented, by which they become diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their place, this crookedneſs hindring the amplification of the breaſt, it happens that the augmenting bowels cannot be long crouded up in too narrow a lodging, ſo that ſherly after gibboſity it introduceth death: not that we may draw a conſequence from this, that the ſick perſons preſently dye, but that they fall far ſhort of that diuturnity of life, to which otherwiſe they might attain.</p>

                        <hi>A Pleuriſie or peripneumony ſucceeding an Aſthma is deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe when the cavities of the lungs are filled with pituitous humor, and the lungs are debilitated, there can be no anacatharſis; and reſpiration is ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by both affections, that the ſick perſon muſt of neceſſity dye, But yet if an anacatharſis be eaſily made, and the other ſymptomes be not too vehement, he may be recovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Peripneumony after a Pleurifie is bad.</hi> Aph. 11. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>This opinion grounds upon a general axiome propoſed by <hi>Hippocrates in his book of diſeaſes, viz.</hi> that the adjunction of one diſeaſe to another is a bad ſigne. But a worſe, when a diſeaſe adjoyned is worſe then the former; worſt of all, when it happens upon a <hi>delumbation</hi> of ſtrength. A peripneumony therefore being more detrimental then a Pleuriſie, and when it ſucceeds that, the ſtrength being much broken by the rude oppreſſion of the antecedent diſeaſe, it is uſually extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bad, and often deadly. Therefore when <hi>Hippocrates in his Aph.</hi> in leſs dangerous caſes uſes the term <hi>bad,</hi> in more perillous <hi>deadly,</hi> he ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have uſed the term deadly here; ſo that <hi>Galen</hi> may not without cauſe doubt, whether that word bad was by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> there placed, being by his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not found in ſome books.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls thoſe parts torn which are much and deeply wounded. So
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153522:89"/>the whole tunicle of the bladder divided to the interiour ſpace, cannot be united; nor ſuch a wound, <hi>viz.</hi> great and deep, in the nervous parts of the midriffe, or in the thin inteſtines. But in the ventricle it is ſometimes, as <hi>Galen</hi> will have it, but ſeldome cured. The reaſon of this is becauſe the bladder is nervous, thin, and bloudleſs, whence it is that wounds in the neck thereof are curable, becauſe that is carnous. But the wounds of the Liver by reaſon of the copious profuſion of bloud are deadly, if ſo be the veines thereof be diſſected; otherwiſe wounds which have toucht onely the outward ſuperficies of the liver are curable. So the wounds of the brain, if they be not very deep, are within the compaſs of skil; but if they touch upon the ventricles, they are deadly.</p>

                     <p>But about the ſeventeenth ſhe was ſpeechleſs, on the twentieth ſhe dyed.

On the ſecond day there was a total exacerbation, delira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at night. The third day was troubleſome to him, with much deliration. The fifth morning he returned to himſelf, and underſtood every thing, but at noon he raved much, could not contain himſelf; his external parts cold, and ſomewhat pale, his urine ſtopped. About ſun-ſet he dyed. The like chances may be ſeen in <hi>aegr.</hi> 12. <hi>of the ſame ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; aegr.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>book</hi> 3. Yet we cannot infer from theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that deliration is neceſſarily deadly to all ſick perſons; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the <hi>beforementioned Aph.</hi> ſaith onely, that it is bad, that is, that it endangers life, though many do frequently eſcape this danger, as is evident in the ſame <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.

                     <p>On the fifth day after he relapſed, was judged the ſeventeenth, neither did he rave: in this recidivation and in <hi>aegr.</hi> 5. <hi>of the ſame ſection:</hi> where the Wife of Epicrates, which lay in at the houſe of <hi>Archegetes,</hi> the ſecond day after her delivery was taken with an acute feaver: on the ſixt with delirations; on the ſeventh a total exacerbation: ſleepleſs, ſhe raved; on the ſixteenth at night troubleſome exacerbations, ſhe ſlept not, ſhe raved. On the eightenth ſhe was thirſty, her tongue ſcorched, ſhe ſlept not, ſhe was in a very great deliration: ſhe was perfectly judged from her feaver on the eightieth day.

And therefore though a deliration be alwaies ominous, yet by it we cannot confidently aſſert the death of the ſick party, unleſs this joyn with other bad and deadly ſignes in a deſtructive conſpiracy; as ſhall more clearely appeare by the following theorems.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Both theſe ſymptomes proceed ſometimes from the laeſion of the braine; then the ſpirits appeare big, as hipp. <hi>in his progn.</hi> ſaith, and as it were at a great diſtance, that is big and thin.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A deliration ſucceeding upon effuſion of blood, obſtruction in the guts; Pleuriſy, or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony, is bad. Aph.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>When it followes an effuſion of blood, it is cauſed by emptineſs, which is very dangerous, when it ſo much debilitates the principal parts. But in other affections when the braine is ſick for company, this ſignifies a very ſtrong and dangerous affection.</p>

                     <p>For this ſignifies the ſupremacy of atribilary humor. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 2. <hi>Silenus</hi> among the other ſymptomes which are there recited, grieved very much the eighth day, and dyed the eleventh.</p>

                     </p>

                        <hi>Deliration accompanied with remarkable oblivion, idleneſs and ſtupidity, is a ſigne of deſtruction.</hi> 2. <hi>Prorrhet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the refrigeration of the braine is the cauſe that they know not their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, nor remember any tranſactions.

                     </p>
                     <p>A phrenſy with laughter is cauſed by blood; but with meditation and fury, by choler: And both are dangrous; but that which proceeds from blood, much leſs. Yet we muſt not preſently aſſert health upon a deliration appearing with mirth; for a phrenſy cauſed by blood even in it ſelf is not without danger, and upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence of the diſeaſe that blood is ſcorched, and naturalizeth it ſelf into black choler, which is evident by the conſequent ſymptomes, and by laughter converted into fury and ſadneſs; as we may find in 1. <hi>Epid.

And therefore on the eleventh he died. We may then aſſert that fondneſs with mirth promiſeth ſome ſecurity, if it continue through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>For it ſometimes happens that phrenitical perſons do ſo repent, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the ſtanders by of very grave and ſerious things, and foreſee future events which may happen to them; and ſuddenly upon this dye, <hi>viz.</hi> the native heat of the brain being now deſtroyed, and ſtruggling its laſt, as a Candle when it is almoſt extinct ſeems to flame more.</p>

                     <p>This is manifeſt when the ſick perſon calls for a chamberpot, and after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to exclude his urine; or demanding water, drinkes not when the cup is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or does but onely taſte it.</p>
                     <p>Of delirations theſe are accounted leſs evil, which are gentle and ſlight, and which hold not the ſick perſon perpetually, but are of a ſhort duration, and with good, or at leaſt not deadly ſignes.</p>
                     <p>Such fondneſs doth moſt frequently happen in the paroxyſmes, or exacerbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of bilious Feavers, in which the choler being ſtirred and exagitated tranſmits vapors to the brain, exciting a fondneſs; which yet are eaſily and ſpeedily diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor do indanger life at all, unleſs they appear with other deadly ſignes. But this fondneſs muſt be gentle and ſlight, for thoſe that are joyned with fierceneſs, though they be ſlight, are uſually bad.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A phrenſie ſucceeding a lethargy is healthy, becauſe it ſignifies that the matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted.</hi>

                        <hi>A fondneſs happening on a critical day, with full ſtrength, and other good ſignes, is not dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this denotes an imminent Criſis, which uſually brings the diſeaſe to a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> in a moroſe woman, the convulſions reſted the third day, a <hi>Coma</hi> and inclination to ſleep; again watching rouſed her, ſhe could not contain, raved much, was taken with an acute Feaver; on the ſame night copious and hot ſweat iſſued out of the whole body, ſhe ſlept free from her feaver, and came to her right underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Sleep and watching. <hi>If either ſleep or watching be exceſsive, it is bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this ſignifies a receſs from the natural ſtate, and a morbous diſpoſition in the principal part, which is alwaies bad.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In any diſeaſe, if ſleep and waking keep their cuſtomary viciſsitudes which they did in the health of the perſon now ſick, it is good.</hi>

                     <p>For it ſeems impoſſible for a man to dye of any diſeaſe, who hath a laudable and unchanged intercourſe of ſleep and waking.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Immoderate watchings are more dangerous in young men; but in old, immoderate ſleep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe the receſs from the natural ſtate is the greater: for young men do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſleep more, becauſe their moiſture is more copious; but old men being more dry are naturally more vigilant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe ſick perſons which can neither ſleep night nor day are in much danger.</hi> Hipp. 2. progn.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe continual watchings ſhew a very great, hot and dry diſtemper of the brain, and very much debilitate the ſtrength, multiply crudities by the reſolution of native heat, and at laſt cauſe fondneſs and convulſions.</p>

                        <hi>Dead ſleep in an acute Feaver is pernicious.</hi>

But the reaſon why a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous affection is in acute diſeaſes ſo pernicious, may be learnt out of <hi>Galens-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the mentioned Hiſtory,</hi> where he argues thus; <hi>It remains therefore that ſome notable refrigeration of the brain, or imbecillity of ſome faculty laid Hermocrates in a deep ſleep the eleventh day; but which ſoever of them two it be, it is extremely dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for we have ſhewen that thoſe colds are incurable which ſucceed hot and dry diſeaſes.</hi> But that which is cauſed by infirmity ſpeaks a propinquity of deſtruction: but when this dead ſleep ſucceeds long watchings, it is more pernicious, for it ſignifies a total extinction of native heat; ſo when phrenitical perſons become comatous, they have one foot in the grave.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That diſeaſe in which ſleep cauſeth trouble is mortal; but where it is advantageous, not mortal.</hi> Aph. 1. Sect. 2.</p>

                     <p>We muſt not think that every trouble after ſleep is deadly: for if it be a light one, as when ſick perſons raiſed from ſleep are more anxious and unquiet, this indeed is bad, but not upon neceſſity deadly: but if after ſleep there appear any dangerous ſymptomes, as fondneſs, convulſion, weakneſs, cold of the extreme parts, and the like, then there is cauſe to think it a deadly affection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When ſleep allayes a fondneſs, it is good.</hi> Aph. 2. Sect. 2.</p>
                     <p>For this ſignifies that the heat and acrimony of the vapors and humors cauſing fondneſs is mitigated by ſleep, and reduced to ſome mediocrity.</p>

                     <p>As we ſaid before that a Coma in acute Feavers is dangerous, ſo a Catoche much more, which is cauſed by a tranſmigration of the more dry matter into the brain and nerves; hence the nerves are bound, and therefore they who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this affection, ſtand at the ſame pitch, and remain ſtupid though their eyes be open and inconnivent; and ſo they differ from Comatous perſons, whoſe eyes are alwaies ſhut.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>For this ſignifies the extinction of the faculty moving the eyelids.</p>
                     <p>Dreams. <hi>Dreams in a Phrenſy remembred, are good ſignes.</hi> 1. Coac. <hi>Aph.</hi> 91.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing more to be deſired in a phrenitical man, then that he fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and ſleep ſweetly. But dreams are ſignes of ſweet ſleep.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe not turbulent ones and tumultuous, but gentle and quiet, which are afterward remembred by the ſick perſons; for this is a ſigne that they are come to themſelves again, and that the brain enjoyes again its formerly moderate temper.</p>

                        <hi>In thoſe who are dangerousſly ſick, dreams of dead men, graves, and prieſts, denote immimennt death.</hi>

                     </p>

                     <p>Thoſe decretory ſignes which ought to attend ſurdity, that it may be called healthy, are principally thoſe ſignes of concoction which uſually appear in excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are perpetually good. So 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 7. There is a ſtory of <hi>Abderitana</hi> a maid, which from the eighth to the ſeventeenth, on which a copious effluxion of blood was conveyed through her noſtrills, was affected with deafneſs,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153522:92"/>which perſevering the following days alſo, denoted the firſt Criſis imperfect, and ſhewed another to come for the reſolution of the diſeaſe, which after a ſecond eruption of blood, ſweat, and tranſition of the humor to her feet, on the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day followed. By which evacuations the diſeaſe not being wholly taken away, her deafneſs on the four and twentieth day returned in company of other ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, which was a nuntio of a completely perfect Criſis on the twenty ſeventh day, which will more clearly appear by the words of the ſtory it ſelf. <hi>On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>proceeded thin, but well coloured urine; as to the excrements of the belly, they were not troubleſome: on the eighth day ſhe was deaf, taken with an acute Feaver, waking, anxious, trembling, in her own mind, voiding the like urine: on the ninth in the ſame condition, and the daies following the deafneſs ſo perſevered: on the ſeventeenth large effluxions iſſued out of the noſe, little of the deafneſs remitted; on the daies following ſurdity, and fondneſs ſeiſed her: on the twentieth a pain of the feet, deafneſs, and fondneſs took her; ſome blood iſſued out at her noſe, ſhe ſweated without a Feaver: on the twenty fourth the Feaver viſites her again, ſurdity again, the pain of her feet remained, with an alienation of mind; on the twenty ſeventh ſhe ſweated much, without a Feaver, her deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs departed, the pain of her feet remained, but in the reſt ſhe was perfectly iudged.</hi>

                     <p>As ſurdity in conjunction with good ſignes is good, ſo with bad it is uſually bad: if therefore the diſeaſe be acute and turbulent, that is, joyned with fondneſs, and other dangerous ſymptomes, deafneſs following upon it threatens death. So in <hi>Hipp. book.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>aegr.</hi> 2. <hi>Hermocrates</hi> was taken with a great feaver, and began to be pained in his head, and loynes, a ſoft tenſion of the hypochondrium; but his tongue at the beginning ſcorcht; deafneſs preſently followed, want of ſleep, not very thirſty, his urine thick, red, and ſeparating, ſubſided not, yet excrements not a few ſcorcht were expelled by the belly. On the fifth day his urine thin, had an <hi>Enaeorema,</hi> did not ſubſide; at night he raved, the ſeven and twentieth day he dyed. And his ſurdity perſiſted with him to the end. So again <hi>Aegr.</hi> 4. <hi>of the ſame ſection, Phileſtes</hi> in <hi>Thaſus</hi> vomited bilious matter, a little yellow firſt, after much eruginous; but the excrements proceeded from his belly in the night with trouble: on the ſecond day he was deaf; on the fifth in the morning he dyed. Yet it is obſervable, that ſurdity alſo joyned with bad ſignes is not perpetually deadly, but dangerous onely, and with it ſome eſcape. As appears in the ſame <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1 <hi>aegr.</hi> 3. where <hi>Herophon</hi> was troubled with an acute feaver, had effluxions from the belly, ſuch as in a <hi>teneſmus</hi> at the beginning. Afterwards iſſued thin, bilious, and ſubcontinuous excrements, ſleep was wanting. The urine was black and thin. On the fifth day, he became in the morning deaf, with a total exacerbation, his milt ſwelled, a contenſion in hypochondrium, he excluded by the belly ſome few; black excrements, and was out of his ſenſes: on the ninth day he ſweated, was judged, intermitted: on the fifth day following he relapſed, his milt was preſently tumefied, he taken with an acute feaver, and deafneſs again. But the third day after this recidivation his milt was aſſwaged, his deafneſs diminiſhed, his leggs pained, at night he ſweated; on the ſeventeenth day he was judged, neither was he idle in his recidivation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If after a Phrenſy, or other grievous diſeaſe of the head, deafneſs ſucceeds upon the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or alleviation of the firſt diſeaſe, the faculty being not debilitated, it is a good ſigne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this is cauſed by the departure of the matter from the internal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of the brain, and then as the reſult of this we may expect impoſtuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignify plenty of humors abounding in the poſtern part of the head, and that part thereof is diffuſed into the <hi>ſpinalis medulla,</hi> or the membranes thereof, which cannot be diſſolved, or concocted by nature. So in 1. <hi>Epid. aegr</hi> 2. <hi>Silenus</hi> ſoon after the beginning of his diſeaſe had a pain in his loyns, and gravity in his head, a contenſion of his neck; on the twentieth day he dyed.

In <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> a woman which brought forth ten daughters, whoſe delivery was difficult, without much purgation, was firſt taken with an horrid and acute feaver, troubled with an heavineſs of the head, and neck attended with pain, on the ſeventeenth day ſhe dyed.

When therefore this ſigne appears in the beginning of a diſeaſe, we may confidently aver by it a very troubleſome and dangerous diſeaſe, on which the ſick perſon will either dye, or be very dangerouſly ill, as appears by the recited ſtories of theſe who have eſcaped, yet with ſhrewd ſymptomes, and much danger of life.</p>

The <hi>dura meninx</hi> is neighbour to the auditory paſſage, ſo that the diſeaſe of one hath an eaſy way of tranſmigration into the other; but they doe ſo differ, as that if upon the affection of the brain a pain ſurpriſe the mentioned paſſage, it will not be a ſigne of fondneſs or death, but a guard and fence againſt them both; for this ſhewes that the morbifick matter is transferred from the internal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts. But if in an acute feaver a pain ariſe without any affection of the brain, it is a ſigne that the humors by that part aſſayl the brain, which will by that effect a Phrenſy, and next death; moſt of all if it be vehement and difficult. But ſuch a diſeaſe (as <hi>Hipp.</hi> informs us <hi>in the quoted place</hi>) diſpatcheth young men on the ſeventh day, or ſooner; but old men much ſlower, for Feavers, and fondneſs more ſeldome happen to them, and ſo their ears will admit of ſuppuration. But at this age recidivation happening kills many: but young men dye before their ears can be ſuppurated; and if white matter be excluded at the eare of a young man, there is hopes of his life, if any other good ſigne happen.</p>

                     <p>This pain of the jaws often happens in malignant and peſtilent Feavers, and is one of the demonſtrative ſignes of that affection; and it is cauſed either by a thin and malignant defluxion from the brain breaking in upon the jaws; or by malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vapors ſent up by the inferiour parts, and vellicating thoſe parts.</p>

                     <p>As in acute Feavers convulſions are cauſed by an hot and dry diſtemper exſiccat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtending the nerves; ſo in the ſame diſeaſe pains in the guts proceed from the vehemency and ſiccity of the inflammation, and the ſtronger theſe pains are, the more they declare the magnitude of the cauſe, and by conſequence of the danger.

                     <p>For in Feavers the pains and heavineſs of the loyns are commonly produced by the weight of the peccant matter, creeping into the <hi>vena cava,</hi> which borders upon the back and loyns; and when this matter is inflamed it excites pains and burnings in the loyns, which ſpeak a dangerous diſeaſe, as well by reaſon of the plenty and acrimony of the morbifick matter, as for that the morbifick matter may by theſe inlets eaſily invade the principal parts. To this add, that heat communicated to the Liver and the parts thereabout, by reaſon of vicinity produceth various ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes-</p>

                     <p>As we ſaid before that ſuch like pains were healthy, when they happen on a critical day accompanied with the ſignes of concoction, as ſignifying that nature doth vnload in the ignoble parts; ſo on the contrary, if they happen in the beginning, in which no healthy expulſion can be by nature made, or at other times alſo with other bad ſignes, they threaten the danger of death.

                     <p>For they ſhew the tranſition of the humors to the noble parts, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>progn.</hi> confirmes. <hi>Pains,</hi> ſiaith he, <hi>which with an acute feaver beſiege the loyns and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts, if they aſſayl the bowels, and leave their inferiour dwellings, they are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</hi> And 1.

                        <hi>Pains of the ignoble parts, which without any manifeſt cauſe do ſoon vaniſh and hide themſelves, are dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are ſaid to withdraw themſelves without any manifeſt cauſe, when they doe abruptly break off without the help of a Phyſician, evacuation, or abſceſſion. For they either ſignify the mind affected, and ſo inſenſible of the pain; or the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the matter to the interiour parts, or the corruption of that part in which ſenſe is deſtroyed. So in the mentioned hiſtory of <hi>Calvus,</hi> the pain of his thigh diſappeared the third day, by reaſon of the tranſmigration of the matter to the brain; or elſe by reaſon of his fondneſs he was not ſenſible of the pain. Theſe are the words of <hi>Hippocrates, On the third day the paine of his thigh ceaſed, but an alienation and perturbation of his mind followed, with much jactation: on the fourth day about noon he died.</hi>

                     <p>Motion. <hi>In any diſeaſe, if the ſick perſon can eaſily riſe and lift himſelf up, and turn himſelf from ſide to ſide, it is a good ſigne; on the contrary, if he cannot without difficulty move himſelf, it is a bad one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the ſoundneſs of any function denotes the levity of a diſeaſe, ſo among the animal functions, if that which belongs to voluntary motion be not hurt, we have the greater hopes; and on the contrary, if it be much detrimented, ſo that the ſick perſons can hardly move themſelves, it is vſually dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Much jactation of the body, anxiety and unquietneſs in an acute feaver, is bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this denotes the ferocity and turgency of the humors, which being thin and very moveable, and vehemently agitated in the body, it is an hazard if they ſally not out upon the principal parts, and produce ſome pernicious affection. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 12. A woman preſently upon the beginning of her diſeaſe was thirſty and anxious. On the ſeventh day ſhe was extreme cold, an acute feaver ſeiſed her, with thirſt, and much jactation. On the eighth day ſhe was again hot about noon, thirſty, comatous, and anxious. On the fourteenth ſhe dyed.</p>
                     <p>Lying down. <hi>That method of lying down is beſt which every one in health obſerves.</hi> Hipp. book. 3. Coac. tract. 1. Aph. 9.</p>
                     <p>But this decumbency which is like that of healthy perſons is by <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>prognoſt.</hi> deſcribed in theſe words; <hi>A ſick perſon muſt ly on his right or left ſide with his armes,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153522:94"/>neck, leggs ſomewhat bended, and the reſt of his body lying eaſily.</hi> For by this ſituation of the body all the parts reſt, and all the muſcles are relaxed, reſpiration more free, and ſleep more pleaſant. If then a ſick perſon taken with an acute diſeaſe obſerve to ly down in this manner, it is a notable ſigne of a vigorous faculty, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports cheerfully, and with no difficulty, and eaſily governs the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The heavineſs of the whole body, hands and feet, is dangerous.</hi> Hipp. 3. Coac. tract. 1. Aph. 3.</p>
                     <p>The gravity of the whole body is diſcovered by this, that the ſick perſon can hardly move himſelf in his bed, and turn upon his ſides, and when he is moved by aſſiſtants, he repreſents a leaden bulk and burden. But the heavineſs of the hands and feet appears by this, that the ſick party can hardly lift up his hand to take meat and drink, or exerciſe any other thing; or if when they be ſo difficultly lifted up, they tremble, or if by being lifted up by the Phyſician, they fall down again like a ſtone. But the heavineſs of the feet is diſcoverable, when they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended without any reflexion to the end of the bed. All theſe are ſignes of a much debilitated and almoſt expiring faculty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ly on the back with the hands, leggs, and neck extended, is bad.</hi> Hipp. 3. Coac. tract. 1. Aph 10. and 1. progn. text. 2.</p>
                     <p>For this argues a great infirmity in the animal faculty, which cannot confine the body to any other ſituation. But this ſupinity is cauſed when the body is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened by its own weight, as appears in men dying, which do alwaies thus ly: and it is more confirmed by the extenſion of the members, which proceeds from their gravity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the ſick perſon cannot contain himſelf, but often fall down to the place of his feet, it is mortal.</hi> Hipp. book 3. Coac. tract. 1. aph. 11.</p>
                     <p>For this ſignifies the animal faculty almoſt extinct, ſo that it cannot govern nor ſuſtain the weight of the body, but it is forced down by its own gravity to the lower parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If one troubled with an acute diſeaſe ſleep gaping, it is mortal.</hi> Hipp. 1. progn. text. 20. and 3. Coac. tract. 1. aph. 12.</p>
                     <p>For this gaping is cauſed either by reaſon of the infirmity and exolution of the faculty moving the jaw bone, or by a great inflammation of the heart, and other parts, whence vapors are effuſed in ſuch plenty, that for their continual excluſion the ſick perſons are forced to ly gaping. But this is principally cauſed in ſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the heat of the inner parts is intended, which ſends up a greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtreams. But if the ſick perſon doth not onely perſiſt gaping in his ſleep, but be in the ſame poſture when he is waking, it is much more dangerous. Yet obſerve, that ſome by aſſuefaction even in health do ſleep gaping: which if the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knows, he cannot from thence take occaſion of a prognoſtick.</p>

                        <hi>To lye upon the belly, for one with whom it is not cuſtomary ſo to ſleep, is bad.</hi> Hipp. 2. Prorrhet. text. 9. and 3. Coac. tract. 1. aph. 13.</p>
                     <p>For this prepoſterous decumbency ſhews either a fondneſs, or error in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or a dangerous affection poſſeſſing the parts of the belly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If a ſick perſon be taken lying with his feet naked, and not very hot, as alſo with his hands, neck, and legs thrown unequally and naked, it is dangerous; for this denotes anguiſh. Hipp.</hi> 3. Coac. tract. 3. aph. 14.</p>
                     <p>When ſick perſons in the greateſt rigor of a feaveriſh exacerbation, being very hot all over their body, do lay naked their body and members to cool, this gives no occaſion of judging danger. But if upon no compelling neceſſity, and when their body is temperate enough, they ſtrip their parts, and toſs their whole body to and fro, this is very dangerous.</p>

The ſignes of both cauſes are ſyllogiſtical: of the firſt, nauſcation, and appetite to vomiting; of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, frequent jactation impatient of a pauſe with out nauſcation. But the principal cauſe of jactation is the faculty languiſhing and oppreſſed; and the cauſe of denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the body is a burning feaver and <hi>lypyria.</hi>

                     <p>For this denotes an obſcure fondneſs, and is ſo dangerous, that <hi>Hollerius in his comm. to the Coac. praenat.</hi> aſhrmes that he never knew any other recover upon theſe ſignes.</p>

                     <p>For this either threatens an imminent phrenſy, by reaſon of which they are ſo unruly, and tumble inconſiderately without any advantage; or it ſhewes a great inflammation of the heart, which by this means they deſire to allay by a more free inſpiration of air; or laſtly, it denotes a great oppreſſion of the ſpiritual parts, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by much inflammation, ſo that reſpiration can hardly be exerciſed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body.</p>

                     <p>Convulſion. <hi>Convulſion,</hi> according to the mind of <hi>Hipp. is either cauſed by reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inainition.</hi> When therefore it happens that any perſon in health is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly convulſed, it is neceſſary that this convulſion ſhould be cauſed by repletion, for then the nerves are ſtuffed with cold and glutinous humors which introduce convulſions: a Feaver therefore coming upon thoſe doth for the moſt part heat, extenuate, digeſt, and ſo reſolve the convulſions. But if a convulſion happen in Feavers, they are moſt ordinarily cauſed by inanition, and drineſs, produced by a burning and ſcorching Feaver; which is a very great, and almoſt incurable evil, becauſe long time will be required to remove the ſiccity of the nerves; but the ſharpneſs of the diſeaſe will admit of no procraſtination, but ſoon diſſolves the ſtrength, and produces deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe Convulſions which appear in the beginnings of acute diſeaſes, are leſs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then thoſe that happen in the ſtate of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All Convulſions which ſucceed Feavers are not deadly, but ſometimes leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if they happen in the beginning; for they then ſignify a multitude of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, by which the nervous parts are ſtretched and convulſed. And they uſe to be far leſs dangerous if they remain not long, becauſe then they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from a fixt cauſe, and they ſhew that the morbifick matter hath removed from the ſtock of the veins into the bulk of the body, by the concuſſion and violent commotion of the body, evident in a Convulſion. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 11. In <hi>Thaſus,</hi> a woman being froward with grief occaſionally cauſed, could not ſleep, and abhorred meats, was thirſty and anxious: in the beginning of the night ſhe talked much, was ſick in mind, troubled with a ſmall Feaver; in the morning with many Convulſions, talked obſcenely, diſturbed with many, great, continual pains: on the ſecond day ſhe was in the ſame condition, ſlept not, had a more acute Feaver. On the third day her Convulſions left her, ſhe fell into drowſineſs, and ſound ſleep, and again waking ſhe leapt up; being unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſelf ſhe talked much, was taken with an acute Feaver, and the ſame night ſhe ſweated much, in a heat all over, without a Feaver, ſhe ſlept, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood every thing, and was judged. About which time her months iſſued copiouſly.</p>
                     <p>We may gather by this ſtory, that her Convulſion appearing in the beginning was cauſed by repletion, not from the authority of <hi>Galen</hi> onely, <hi>in his commentary on this place,</hi> where heaffirmes that this womans months were ſurppreſſed, but alſo by thoſe evacuations by which ſhe was freed, <hi>viz.</hi> by copious and univerſal ſweats, and by the plentiful effluxion of her months, according to the common axiome, <hi>diſeaſes cauſed by repletion are cured by inanition.</hi> But if a convulſion appear in the ſtate of a diſeaſe, it is more dangerous, for it is either generated by ſiccity introduced by a feaveriſh aduſtion, or by the tranſition of the morbiſick humor to the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which are cauſed by drineſs are wholly pernicious and deadly; but thoſe which are produced by permutation are ſometimes curable, as thoſe which proceed from the bitings of the orifice of the ventricle, and in hyſterical women, and thoſe which happen critically.

                     <p>A Tetanus is cauſed by an emproſthotonos, that is, a tenſion to the interiors, and an opiſthotonos, that is a tenſion to the poſteriors; for in it the convulſion of the oppoſite muſcles is equal, which do therefore ſo vehemently afflict nature that ſhe cannot long endure thoſe pains, cheifly when the whole body, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the neck is ſtiffe with cold; for then beſides thoſe horrid pains which quickly diſſolve the ſtrength, the diaphragma is alſo affected by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, whereas the nerves produced to the diaphragma make out from the fourth vertebra of the neck, and ſo the neck being convulſt reſpiration is hardened, and the perſons ſo affected die by ſuffocation within four daies. But if they eſcape them upon the mitigation and diſſolution of the diſeaſe by judication, which happens in extremely acute diſeaſes on the fourth day, they are freed from this dangerous diſeaſe.
<q>Convulſion upon a wound is deadly. <hi>Aph. 2. Sect. 5.</hi>
                        </q> The ſucceſſion of a convulſion to a wound proceeds from four cauſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> when the wound happens to fall upon the great veins and arteries, upon which a large flux of bloud followes, which cauſeth a convulſion and ſwouning; but death is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the effect of this convulſion and <hi>Syncope. Secondly,</hi> when the wound is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the ſtock of nerves, by reaſon of which that convulſion of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts followes which is called <hi>Spaſmus. Thirdly,</hi> when there is an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the wound, which being extended to the nerves becomes a convulſion. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> when the ulcer is not well purged, or cloſed before its time, or when the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153522:96"/>orifice of the wound is too narrow, as in the pricking of a nerve; for then the ſharp putrefaction being retained vellicates the nerves, and excites a convulſion. But this convulſion is deadly, becauſe it inſinuates by ſympathy into the brain, the nerves being vehemently affected; and becauſe putrid feculency retained in the wound is ſometimes tranſmitted into the noble parts. And this Convulſion, ſaith <hi>Galen in his comm. on this Aph.</hi> is deadly, not as implying a neceſſary conſequence of death, but as very often introducing it. Which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf ſeemed to acknowledge, who in his <hi>Coac. progn.</hi> propoſing the ſame opinion, in the place of <hi>deadly</hi> inſerts <hi>dangerous.</hi>

                     <p>Convulſion followes an immoderate loſs of bloud, either when the veines and arteries are robbed of that due proportion of bloud which they ſhould contain, and being empty are contracted, and being contracted contract the nerves; or becauſe the veines exhauſted attract from the neighbouring parts, demanding mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual courteſie, and ſo being dried with long profuſion of bloud, ſeek aliment from the nerves, which forceth the exſiccated and contracted nerves to a convulſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement to the fountain head, as it were to derive help from it; or elſe becauſe the veines and arteries being immoderately exhauſted, hurry away not onely the bloud but all the ſpirits from the extreme parts, whence the nerves are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly refrigerated; hence ariſeth an extremporary, not a long convulſion, not proceeding from a preternatural cauſe, but rather produced by the action of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and endeavouring to hinder the detriment of this inanition: therefore we ſaid before that a convulſion upon a flux of bloud was not alwaies deadly, though dangerous, becauſe no convulſions cauſed by inanition wants danger.</p>

                     <p>It holds not onely true in quotidian, but in tertian and quartan recourſes, that feavers are reſolved by a precedent coldneſs; and hence we collect that there is no danger in coldneſs of intermitting feavers, and that it gives no cauſe of fear.</p>

                     <p>Good evacuations following ſuch colds are copious ſweats, vomits, dejection of the belly, or flux of bloud, by which feavers are either wholly taken away, or much remitted, of which <hi>Hippocrates Aph.</hi> 58. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153522:97"/>was cold, convulſt, was fond in all, paſſed the night with trouble; on the fourth he had ſome quiet, ſlept a little, talked. On the fifth day he was troubled, all exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbated, he was fond, paſſed the night with moleſtation, ſlept not. On the ſixth day in the ſame condition. On the ſeventh day he was extreme cold, taken with an acute Feaver, ſweated all over, was judged; this man all along had bilious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections few and ſincere from his belly; thin urine, well-coloured, having a cloudy <hi>enaeorema.</hi> About the eighth day his urine was better, and more coloured, having a white ſmall ſediment; he was in his ſenſes, without a Feaver, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But about the fourteenth day an acute Feaver ſurpriſed him, and he ſweated. On the ſixteenth he vomited bilious matter, yellow, &amp; ſomewhat copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. On the ſeventeenth he was extreme cold, and ſeiſed by an acute Feaver, he ſweated, was without a Feaver, and was judged: his urine after his relapſe and Criſis was of a better colour, having ſediment; neither was he fond in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidivations: on the eighteenth he was a little hot, thirſted, had thin urine, clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>enaeorema,</hi> was ſomewhat diſipient: About the nineteenth he was without a Feaver, was pained in his neck, had ſediment in his urine, on the twentieth was perfectly judged. In this ſick perſon cold firſt happened on the third day to no purpoſe, as well becauſe that day is ſeldome decretory, as for that there appeared not any ſignes of concoction, neither followed there any excretion; and ſo all the before propoſed conditions of good cold were wanting; but the cold happening on the ſeventh day was healthy, becauſe it appeared on a critical day with the precedent ſignes of concoction: for his urine was indeed thin, and of a good colour, having a cloudy <hi>enaeorema,</hi> with copious evacuation, for he ſweated all over; therefore on the eighth day which followed the Criſis, he was without a Feaver, yet the diſeaſe was not wholly taken away, but very much diminiſhed: for we ſaid before, that by ſuch colds Feavers were either taken away, or very much diminiſhed; and the morbifick cauſe being not wholly driven away by the mentioned ſweats, he relapſed, which on the ſeventh day a cold again followed, in company with the aforeſaid conditions, <hi>viz:</hi> ſweats, and concocted urine: therefore his Feavers left him again, and he was on the twentieth day perfectly judged. That is alſo obſervable in this hiſtory which is remarked by <hi>Hipp.</hi> in both colds, which happened on the ſeventh and the ſeventeenth day that the Feaver was much inflamed, for in both places he ſaith, <hi>he was cold, and, taken with an acute Feaver;</hi> whereas in all Critical cold the more the body is heated, the better and more perfect judication followeth, for this declares nature ſtrong, and to operate powerfully the excluſion of the morbifick matter.</p>

                        <hi>Colds, after which the body is not at all or very little heated, are bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie nature to be in a languiſhing condition, and unable to make head againſt the morbifick cauſe, whence <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1. <hi>Prorrhet: refrigeration not reſuming heat after coldneſs is bad.</hi> For that as <hi>Galen in his comm.</hi> writes, denotes an extinction of heat.

                     <p>Iudicatories which judge not are bad; ſo ſweat breaking forth on a Critical
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153522:98"/>day, if it be not beneficial to the ſickperſon, but ſhaking followed it, is a bad ſigne; for it ſhewes that either the uſeful humors onely were evacuated by ſweat, and the vſeleſs and copious keep their ſtation; or that a part onely of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved humors was evacuated by ſweat, but the reſt dwell within, and vellicate the ſenſible parts, and ſo cauſe ſhaking. It is therefore evident that either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo weak that ſhe cannot rid her ſelf of the morbifick matter, or the humors ſo ſtrong that they give nature the foile.</p>
                     <p>Sternutation. <hi>It is obſerved that if a ſick man ſneeſe onely once, that he will yeild up to the ferocity of the diſeaſe; but if he ſneeſe twice, the diſeaſe will loſe the day, and he recover. But the contrary is noted in women, if any of them dangerouſly ſick ſneeſe twice, this is deſtructive and exitial; if the ſneeſe be once, it is an healthy ſign.</hi> Foreſt. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. 487. <hi>diſtillations of the head, and ſneeſings precedent or ſubſequent in the diſeaſes of the lungs, are bad. But in other, even exitial diſeaſes, ſneeſings raiſe hopes of ſolution.</hi> Hipp. 2. progn. chap. 16.</p>
                     <p>In a phthiſis, pleuriſie, and peripneumony, by that concuſſion of the brain ſneeſing, the parts of the breaſt are lacerated and violently torn, which increaſeth much the inflammation, and ſo there is no vacuation of the morbifick matter. But in other diſeaſes the morbifick cauſe may be diſſipated and diſpelled by the ſtrength of nature ſallying upon it by that violent motion; therefore ſneeſing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that nature reſumes ſtrength, and is excited to expulſion, whence we may conjecture that it is the beginning of a recovery. <hi>Galen in his comment on this place</hi> affirms, that ſternutation without rheume in the declination of a diſeaſe, or after the ſickneſs is paſt, is alwaies a good ſign, though the ſickneſs be pernicious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sternutation happening to a woman in hyſterical fits, or when ſhe brings forth with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sneeſing is very commodious in hyſterical ſuffocations, diſſicult labour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſecundines, both as a ſigne and as a cauſe; as a ſigne, becauſe it ſhews that nature is mindful of her proper motions, and that being before dulled, ſhe is now excited and revived, becauſe ſhe caſts out ſome ſuperfluity; as a cauſe, for that by vehement concuſſion and fervour it partly rouſes up nature, partly cauſeth excretion of thoſe things which adhere to the parts of the body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſpiration.</hi> For as <hi>Galen</hi> inſtructs us <hi>in his com.</hi> good reſpiration ſignifies that the breaſt, heart, lungs, ribs, midriffe, and all the parts ſubſervient to ſpiration are in good caſe. And when they are ſo, we need fear no danger from an acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, unleſs it be malignant and peſtilent. For ſuch feavers do often as it were ſurpriſe us by an ambuſcado, ſo that we cannot be ſenſible of any injury offered to reſpiration, though in their progreſs they are deadly affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When in a not intermitting Feaver difficulty of ſpiration and deſipiency happen, it is a deadly ſigne.</hi> Aph. 50. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the two grand Patrons of life, the heart and brain are vehemently hurt, and ſympathize to deſtruction: but both paſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> deſipience, and difficulty of ſpiration, muſt laſt long that they may be called mortal; for both ſometimes do happen healthfully in a critical perturbation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great and unfrequent reſpiration in an acute Feaver is very bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this ſhews a fondneſs either preſent or imminent; for the minde being imployed in entertaining the multitude of ſpecies repreſented in fondneſs, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers another way the faculty, moving the muſcles of the breaſt, ſo that there paſſeth no reſpiration, unleſs upon the inforcement of abſolute neceſſity, which cauſeth it to be unfrequent; but the magnitude thereof doth ſatisfie for the rarity.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153522:98"/>So it falls out by the ſame reaſon that melancholicks and lovers have not ſeldom ſuch great and unfrequent reſpiration, becauſe being fixt in deep meditations they forget to breath. But the danger of this great and rare reſpiration in acute diſeaſes may be gathered out of <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 2. Where <hi>Silenus,</hi> who died on the eleventh day, had to the end reſpiration great and rare.

                        <hi>Great and frequent reſpiration is dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this denotes a great inflammation, and putrefaction next neighbour to the heart, and the adjacent parts, which wanting much ventilation, cauſeth great and frequent reſpiration.</p>

                        <hi>Small and frequent reſpiration is dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this ſignifies, by the teſtimony of <hi>Hipp. in his Epid.</hi> the pain of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſo as the animal faculty, in commiſeration of the pain, will not ſuffer thoſe parts which are above the diaphragma to be much dilated, that the pain may be the leſs, and the motions violated. It therefore cauſeth ſmall reſpiration. But becauſe this ſmall reſpiration cannot afford ſufficient ventilation to the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled inflammation, neither is therefore forced to make up that which is detracted from magnitude. But this pain cauſing ſuch reſpiration, is produced by inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, abſceſſe, ulcer, or copious and crude humors, all which threaten danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In feavers, offending breath is bad, for it ſignifies a convulſion.</hi> Aph. 68. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>By offending breath he underſtands interrupted or interciſe breath, which breaks off abruptly in the middle of reſpiration. And this may happen as well in inſpiration, and is by <hi>Hipp.</hi> termed double, intro-revocation, as it were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpiration, which frequently happens in crying children; as alſo in expiration, but more ſeldome, and it is called by <hi>Hipp.</hi> offending ſpirit, when it is conveyed to the exterior parts. This aphoriſme is to be underſtood of both, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſignifies in feavers a convulſion; becauſe the muſcles and nerves prepared for convulſion do ſo move the breaſt, which diſpoſition being increaſed, and over-ſpreading more parts, a manifeſt convulſion ſeiſeth on the man.</p>

                        <hi>In acute paſſions accompanying a Feaver luctuous ſighings are bad.</hi> Aph. 54. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>This aphoriſme is in this like the former, becauſe that by ſighing we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that interrupt and reduplicate reſpiration which was before explained. But now this reſpiration is moſt commonly worſe and deadly, when it is luctuous, that is, when it is ſent forth with ſome kind of lamentation and groning; for it ſignifies a kind of a dolorous diſpoſition, or rather plenty of atrabilary humor, which inducing a kind of ſadneſs, doth force ſuch a groning to proceed from ſick perſons, though unwilling.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For this ſignifies a total infirmity of ſtrength; for the diſeaſe having now made a large progreſs, and the diaphragma being inſufficient for reſpiration, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtall muſcles come in as aiders, and if neither theſe alſo be ſufficient, thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilagoes are by nature diducted, endeavoring to attract more air: but this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is fruſtrated no leſs then hiation in dying perſons.</p>

But old men and children are affected by a ſmaller cauſe, yet ſuperable with more eaſe: yet experience ſeems to be antagoniſt to the opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> there being very few Phyſicians who have not known ſome young men eſcaping upon ſuch intermiſſion of pulſe. But leſt the authority of <hi>Galen</hi> ſhould be violated, we thus defend it, ſaying, that the intermitting pulſe is cauſed two waies, either when it intermits equally, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two intermiſſions, the number of pulſations is perpetually the ſame; and this intermitting pulſe is alwaies deadly, of which <hi>Galens</hi> opinion is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: or when it doth unequally intermit, and then the ſick perſons may eſcape.

Or truly we may ſay, that in the beginning chiefly of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and peſtilent feaver, the pulſes do appear almoſt connatural, becauſe the heart is rather affected by the poiſon, then an hot diſtemper, which cauſeth theſe notable mutations in the pulſe: though in the progreſs of a diſeaſe the pulſe doth uſually appear frequent, ſmall, weak, and diverſe.</p>

                     <p>Loathing of meat being by it ſelf a bad ſign in long diſeaſes, (for in thoſe who are like to eſcape the danger of ſuch diſeaſes a contrary affection doth uſually happen, <hi>viz.</hi> an earneſt appetency of meat) if ſincere dejections follow it, they give cauſe of a far worſe preſage: whereas by ſincere dejections <hi>Hipp.</hi> underſtands thoſe which are not mixt with watriſh humidity, when the humor alone is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, deſtitute of its ſerum, whether it be bilious or melancholick: for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections demonſtrate that all the native humidity is ſcorched by feaveriſh heat.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A dyſenteria is cauſed by ſharp humors exulcerating the inteſtines, firſt glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the outermoſt ſuperficies, but in progreſs of times cauſing more deep and putrid ulcers, in which time chiefly the ventricle alſo ſympathizing with them, doth not well perform concoction: which compaſſion more and more creeping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuperiour parts, when the mouth of the ventricle is alſo affected, then ſick perſons are offended with meat. They do indeed from the beginning ſometimes loath meat, becauſe of bad humors flowing from the liver, by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines are abraded, eſpecially when theſe humors have obtained a bilious nature, for the overflowing part of them is conveyed to the mouth of the ventricle. But if this chance to fall out in long diſeaſes of the inteſtines, it ſignifies that the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is as it were mortified by compaſſion, in which, appetency, the neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of life, is wholly loſt. But if a feaver accompanied with inappetency ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the pain of the inteſtines, it is cauſed by one of theſe two, either putridity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ulcers, or great inflammation; both of which is very exitious.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For this depraved appetite is either the conſequent of notable evacuations, which the ſick perſons doth in vain endeavour to make up by theſe great repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or of the acrimony of immenſe heat, which like a furnace conſumes the ſuel of aliments, and reduceth them as it were to aſhes, as may be noted in many lean hecticks; in whom alſo this boulimia often happens, by reaſon of the notable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the meſaraick veins, hindring the paſſage of the chyle to the liver whence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153522:100"/>none, or very ſmall nutrition is made, becauſe that chylous matter finding its way through the liver blocked up, is corrupted in the inteſtines, and expelled by the belly, whence it is that ſuch hectickes have a perpetual and immedicable flux of the belly. The parts therefore being abridged from theſe cates, alwaies attract aliment from the liver, and the liver from the ventricle; which attraction cauſeth alwaies this divulſion in the ventricle, and cheifly in the upper orifice thereof, whence hunger neceſſarily enſues. Or alſo that intenſe appetite depends upon the acid humors ſettled on the orifice of the ventricle, which perpetually vellicate that part, being more exquiſitly ſenſible.

                     <p>Such appetite, which wanders to abſurd and aliene things, is familiar to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child, by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of their months, which collects a multitude of depraved excrements, and cauſeth a reflux of them to the ventricle; and in theſe it is not very dangerous, becauſe all thoſe excrements in parturition are purged: but in chronical diſeaſes it is very bad, as well in reſpect of the cauſe as the ſigne; for while they glut themſelves with theſe cacochymous meats, the morbifick cauſes are multiplied; and it denotes a deſtruction of the temper of the parts and humors, by reaſon of which they deſire things like them. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates therefore wiſely obſerved, <hi>Aph.</hi> 31. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. that if the ſick perſon had an earneſt appetite to meat ſomething bad, we ſhould ſometimes give way to ſuch deſire, but with ſuch moderation, that by reaſon of the quality or quantity it may not aggravate the diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>There are ſome ſick perſons found, who are not refreſhed by water, ſyrup, tempered wine, or any ſuch uſual liquour, but deſire ſtrong drinke, diſagreeing both with the diſeaſe, and their nature; for inſtance, if they deſire to drink vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, juyce of limmons, acquavitae, or any other liquor not convenient to drink.

                        <hi>If any in a troubleſome Feaver have an hiccough, the diſeaſe is very bad.</hi> 1. Coac. Aph. 47.</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:153522:100"/>
                     <p>For this hiccough is cauſed by ſharp and malignant humors vellicating the interior tunicle of the ſtomach, and ſtimulating the expulſive faculty thereof; and Valeſius ſaith that he never ſaw any perſon ſaved, whom being extenuated, and taken with a burning or malignant Feaver, an hiccough ſurpriſed. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 12. a woman on the twelfth day was troubled frequently with hiccoughes, and on the fourteenth dyed. Platerus obſerved, that an hiccough ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a burning Feaver, and perſevering, is uſually deaths nuntio: and in a ſemitertian Feaver he experienced it to be not deadly. But he obſerved it alſo to be deadly in a dyſenteria.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An hiccough and redneſs of the eyes after vomiting is bad.</hi> Aph. 3. Sect. 7. Theſe two ſignes if in acute diſeaſes they ſucceed vomiting, and laſt for ſome time, are accounted deadly, becauſe they denounce an inflammation of the brain or ventricle; which inflammation may not onely be the cauſe of the hiccough it ſelf, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the eyes, but of vomiting alſo; for if vomit were cauſed by ſharp humors biting the mouth of the ventricle, and the tunicles thereof, thoſe humors being expelled by vomiting, the hiccough and redneſs would ceaſe; nor would any ſharp vapour be conveyed to the eyes after vomiting, which ſhould paint them in red. But when vomiting is not onely unprofitable, but alſo introduceth an hiccough, and redneſs of the eyes, it is infallibly true that thoſe three, vomit, hiccough, &amp; redneſs of the eyes, do depend upon the inflammation of the brain or ventricle. For the brain being inflamed ſqueezes out the bloud through the ſmall veins of the eyes by reaſon of the copiouſneſs of it, and effuſeth it into the outermoſt tunicle of the eye which is called adnate; whence proceeds the redneſs of the eyes; with which the ventricle ſympathizing by the nerves, which from the ſixth conjugation make to the mouth thereof, is eaſily impelled to a vomit, and hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough. The ventricle alſo inflamed induceth vomiting, and after vomiting an hiccough, and with an hiccough, a redneſs of the eyes, by a concourſe of bloud too hot to the eyes, cauſed by a compaſſionative diſpoſition which theſe parts one bear to another; which eaſily appears in the beginning of ſuffuſions, and appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of images before the eyes, happening moſt uſually upon the viliation of the ventricle. Whence <hi>Hipp. in his book of the places in man</hi> well, ſaid that the eyes were much injured by vomiting. We have an example of this hiccough ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vomit in the mentioned hiſtory of the woman, in whom it is probable that an inflammation of the ventricle was cauſed by the affluxion of depraved humors to that part: for on the eighth day ſhe vomited bilious, thin, yellowiſh matter; on the ninth thin, bilious; on the eleventh virulent, bilious, ſoon after ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold, her extreme parts were cold; at evening ſhe ſweated, was cold, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited much, paſſed the night with diſquiet; on the twelfth ſhe vomited much black, ſtinking matter; ſhe paſſed it unquietly, with frequent hiccough, and thirſt: on the fourteenth day ſhe dyed.</p>

                        <hi>Hiccough upon an inflammation of the liver is bad.</hi> Aph. 17. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>An hiccough then ſucceeds an inflammation of the liver, as <hi>Gal. in his comment. on this aphoriſme</hi> affirmes, when the inflammation is made worſe and increaſed: for then a great inflammation in the liver is ſo far heightned, that it doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently oppreſs the ſuperior parts of the ventricle, ſo that induceth an hiccough; upon copiouſneſs of matter alſo ſometimes an inflammation or an eryſipelas is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ventricle; nevertheleſs a biting is cauſed by it imbibed by the tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the ventricle.</p>
                     <p>Belching. <hi>In laevities of the inteſtines, an acid ructation proceeding which before was not, is a good ſigne.</hi> Aph. 1. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>A lienteria is moſt commonly cauſed by a cold diſtemper of the ventricle, by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:153522:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>which the coction thereof is aboliſhed, that the aliments are ſpeedily excreted, before either their colour, ſmell, or any other quality is changed. But if in ſuch a lienteria long contracted, an acid ructation ſucceeds, which before was not, it will be a good ſigne: for it hence appears, that the diſtemper begins to be reſtored, and native heat again excited, which by ſuch a lienteria was ſo debilitated that it could not ſo much as attempt a mutation of the aliment. For though an acid ructation ſhews a notable refrigeration of the ventricle, yet to diſcharge ſome flatulencies, though acid ones, ſhews leſs refrigeration, then to ſend out none.</p>
                     <p>Excrements through the eyes. <hi>If a ſick perſons eyes in Feavers or other diſeaſes drop tears voluntarily, it is not abſurd; but if not voluntarily, it is more abſurd.</hi> Aph. 51. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are called voluntary tears, which ſpring from ſome manifeſt and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, as ſadneſs, greif, and ſometimes joy, which are not dangerous. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary ones are either cauſed by inflammation of the eyes, or ſharp fluxions into them, and theſe alſo are void of danger; or they proceed from a Critical perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do chiefly preſage a Criſis by flux of bloud, which alſo threaten no danger, and are known to be ſuch by the precedent ſignes of concoction, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of bad ſymptomes: or laſtly, they ariſe from the reſolution of the retentive virtue, which is in the corner, and other parts of the eye, and theſe are exiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which <hi>Hipp. in this aphoriſme</hi> mentions; and they are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by the cavity, and extenuation of the eyes, and other ſymptomes which are their neceſſary train.</p>
                     <p>By the ears. <hi>In a troubleſome affection of the head, if purulent matter flow out of the ears, there is a ſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This theorem is ſpun from <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>When the head is diſturbed with pain or ſounds, purulent matter, or water, or bloud flowing through the ears, or mouth, or noſtrills, cauſeth a ſolution of the diſeaſe.</hi> For theſe are the ordinary conveyances and paſſages, by which the brain doth uſually unburden it ſelf. But the chief and moſt troubleſome affection of the brain is inflammation, which if it proceed to ſuppuration, and purulent matter be evacuated by the ears, which in this caſe is the more ordinary way, the conſequent is the ſolution of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In children copious humidities iſſuing through the ears are healthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such humidities are frequent in children, according to the experience of <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 24. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and they are healthy, becauſe in that age the brain being very moiſt, and abounding with excrements, purgeth it ſelf healthfully not by the ears onely, but by other paſſages alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The feculencies of the ears, which are naturally yellow and bitter, if they ſweeten, or change colour it is very bad.</hi> Hipp. 6. Epid. <hi>Galen in his comment.</hi> affirmes this to happen by the colliquation of the brain in acute Feavers; or we may ſay, that upon much debilitation of the native heat, theſe watriſh humidities ſtream forth, which were contained in the brain, and being confuſed with thoſe dregs they change the taſt and colour of them.</p>
                     <p>Through the noſtrills. <hi>Bloud flowing well and copiouſly through the noſtrills on a Critical day is healthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For then this evacuation is cauſed by the good operation of nature expelling the morbifick cauſe: but we muſt diligently obſerve, how the ſignes of concoction proceeded, and whether there be any malignity lurking in the diſeaſe: becauſe in malignant diſeaſes ſuch fluxes of bloud are not ſeldome unprofitable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fluxes of bloud too copious and vehement are very bad; for they cauſe convulſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſometimes happens, that nature oppreſſed with the copiouſneſs of bloud, and moved to excretion, becomes irregular, and effects a ſupercriſis, which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153522:101"/>are often forced to reſtrain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Flux of bloud in the beginning of a diſeaſe is bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe in the beginning of a diſeaſe no evacuation can be Critical, but is meerly ſymptomatical: yet it is not therefore deadly, but onely uſeleſs, and not commodious to the ſick perſon: as it happened to <hi>Pericles, in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 6. out of whoſe left noſtril on the third day bloud flowed; afterward his Feaver was very intenſe, and perſevered to the fourth day, in which by copious ſweat he was judged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A flux of bloud happening in a direct line to the part affected, is good; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the inflammation of the liver a Critical flux of bloud is healthy, but with this caution, that evacuation be made through the right noſtril; for if it proceed through the left, it will not regulate it ſelf to that rectitude ſo much applauded by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and it will ſhew that nature upon a perturbation operates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly. So in the inflammation of the milt the bloud muſt flow through the left, not the right noſtril.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Few drops of bloud diſtilling through the noſtrills are bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie the imbecillity of nature, and malignity of the diſeaſe: for all excretions in acute diſeaſes which are inchoate onely and not perfected, are very much diſliked by <hi>Hippo.</hi> becauſe the ſecurity is greater in thoſe Feavers in which nature expells nothing, then in which it makes few and uſeleſs excretions; for then this argues that ſhe is induſtriouſly labouring coction. To this adde, that if no drop appear, the benignity of the matter is declared, which is unable to provoke nature before the time. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. aegr.</hi> 1 <hi>Phyliſcus</hi> on the fifth day had few drops diſtilling from his noſtrils, and on the ſixth day he died. And <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. <hi>of the ſame Sect.</hi> on the fourth day ſome few diſtillations iſſued from the noſtrils of the wife of <hi>Dromeada,</hi> and on the ſixth day ſhe died. Yet upon this ſigne we cannot poſitively aſſert death; for in 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 2. He who lay in <hi>Dealces</hi> garden, had on the ſecond day ſome few ſincere effluxions of bloud from his left noſtril, and again on the fourth few and ſincere diſtillations out of the ſame noſtril, and on the fourtieth day he was judged. Yet he ſtruggled with a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe, as appears through the whole relation of the ſtory, therefore this diſtillation of bloud, if it portend not death, yet it ſhews very great danger of life, if it be accompanied by other bad ſymptomes. For this alſo is to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi> that a ſmall excretion of bloud appearing in an indicative day, without dangerous ſignes antecedent or conſequent, is ſo far from being dangerous, that it rather denounces that a Criſis will come the ſame way, as happened to <hi>Meton, in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>aegr.</hi> 7. who on the fourth day without the precedency of any dangerous ſymptomes, had twice a ſmall effluxion of bloud out of the right noſtril; on the fifth one larger out of his left, ſincere; he ſweated, and was judged, and fell to a recidivation; he eſcaped upon the copious and frequent profluxion of bloud.</p>
                     <p>By the mouth, ſpetting and ſneezing. <hi>Spettle white, even, ſmooth, not very thin, or craſs, of a ready and eaſie excretion, and without any pain or much coughing, is healthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it denotes that nature overpowers the morbifick matter, and laudably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts, and ſufficiently expels it being concocted. For the mentioned qualities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in ſpettle are ſignes of very good concoction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spettle ſoon appearing in the beginning of a diſeaſe of the breaſt or lungs, is good.</hi> Aph. 12. Sect. 1.</p>
                     <p>For this diſcovers a rudiment of concoction, which if it proceed ſoon after the beginning of the diſeaſe, there is hope of a ſpeedy ſolution.</p>

                        <hi>Spettle lightly red by the permiſtion of bloud and flegme, is healthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſpettle is expelled in a pleuriſy, when nature changes the morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it doth by degrees extenuate it to liquation, and ſo the waies being freed, by which the vapour ſhould exhale, the thinner part and moſt acceeding to vapor, ſteals through the rarity of the pores into the internal and neighbouring ſpaces, and is confuſed with flegme, whence upon coughing, and excluſion of ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the default of coction appears; and hence <hi>Gal. comment. in</hi> 6. <hi>Epid.</hi> termes theſe moſt gentle pleurifies.</p>

                     <p>In inflammations produced by choler and bloud, ſuch ſpettle uſually happens; which if it appear upon the beginning of the diſeaſe, it ſhews that nature doth partly unburden herſelf, whence proceeds a looſeneſs in the part, and remiſſion of pain, and ſo the beginning of ſanation. But if this ſpettle appear after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath made ſome progreſs, on the ſeventh, or eleventh day onely, it is a ſigne of leſs ſecurity; becauſe the faculties requiſite to cauſe an anacatharſis are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the diſeaſe, ſo that we cannot conceive hopes of a laudable operation: as alſo becauſe the morbifick matter is more rebellious, the more thin and obedient part of which could not be thruſt forth in the firſt daies: and again, for that by a delayed heſitation in the part, it hath inſinuated it ſelf to a ſettlement in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, ſo that it cannot without more difficulty be removed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All ſpettle is bad which doth not allay pain.</hi> Hipp. 2. progn.</p>
                     <p>All evacuations are to be judged good or bad as they redound to the benefit of the perſon: if therefore the pain be not mitigated by anacatharſis, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bad: for either the matter immediately producing the diſeaſe is not ejected; or if any part of it be evacuated, it is ſupplied by new which hinders the diminution of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſmall quantity of ſpettle, though concocted, if it be not expelled conformably to the diſeaſe, is bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe no ſmall quantity is Critical, and cannot cauſe any remiſſion; this ſpettle therefore is in a peripneumony dangerous, according to <hi>Hippocrates in Coac.</hi> ſuch as <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved 7. <hi>Epid.</hi> in the wife of <hi>Euxenus,</hi> who died of that diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſpet nothing at all in a pleurifie, or peripneumony, after ſome progreſs of the diſeaſe, is exitious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though nothing be expelled in the beginning of the diſeaſe, it is not ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but in the augmentation, or ſtate, if there appear no ſpettle, it ſignifies the diſeaſe to be very crude, and ſhews the inflammation to be contumacious, and of difficult concoction. Hence <hi>Hippocrates in Coac.</hi> averred with good cauſe, that dry pleurifies, in which nothing was expelled by ſpettle, were moſt dangerous: and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>of Criſis chap.</hi> 10. <hi>When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a paſſion is exquiſitely narrow, and confines as it were to it ſelf the whole ſtreams of fluxes, then it cauſeth deadly diſeaſes.</hi> And <hi>in his book, of the times of the whole diſeaſe</hi> he affirmes, that to ſpet nothing at all, with great pain, and difficulty of ſpiration, is deſtructive.</p>

                        <hi>If ſpettle after appearance be ſuppreſſed, and the lungs being full boyle up in the throat, cauſing a ratling and ebullition, it is deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this either ſignifies a very high inflammation, which by ſcorching the ſpettle reduceth it to ſuch a viſcidity that it cannot be expectorated; but adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the cavities of the lungs, and obſtructing them induceth a ſuffocation: or it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:153522:102"/>ſhews an exolution of ſtrength, which cannot produce an anacatharſis; whence it is, that all thoſe that dye of a pleuriſie or peripneumony, when they ſtand at the brinks of the grave, are ſubject to ſuch a ratling. Such a ratling <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved 7. <hi>Epid.</hi> in <hi>Menon,</hi> of whom he ſaith, <hi>His arteries did leap with ratling;</hi> and of the wife of <hi>Theodorus, A kind of ſhrill aſperity of the artery and breaſt, a noiſe and fluctuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purulent matter:</hi> and of the wife of <hi>Polycrates, within about the artery and jaws there was an hiſſing,</hi> or according to interpreters, <hi>an unpleaſant aſperity.</hi> In which, and many other perſons in the ſame book recited, this ſymptome was to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted partly to the weakneſs of nature, partly to the copiouſneſs and clammineſs of purulent matter, flegm, or ſome other humor. This being perpetually bad, and very much to be feared, yet it is extremely pernicious after the beginning of the diſeaſe, upon the languidneſs of ſtrength: for it diſcovers that nature is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that ſhe is not able to expel any thing, and ſo is ſuffocated; which alſo other deſperate ſignes will evidence, which will be the neceſſary concomitants of it. But in the beginning it ſometimes happens, that by reaſon of the copiouſneſs and clammineſs of the humor it boyles in the throat, which humor being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward concocted, and purged by ſpettle, that ebullition ceaſeth. But that this is not pernicious will appear, for that there are other good ſignes without the company of any pernicious one, as happened in <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> of whom ſaith <hi>Hipp.</hi> he had a ratling in his jaws, but he bore the diſeaſe well, was of aſound mind, remiſs heat, and excretion and the ratling came forth together.

                        <hi>Spettle yellow, pale, or ruddy, appearing in healthy perſons, whether it be bitter or ſweet, ſhew the appropinquation of a Phthiſis, and from thence death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſuch colours ſignifie choler lurking in the lungs, which in the ſpettle hath loſt much of its amaritude, by the permiſtion of flegme, by the ſweetneſs of which the acrimony of the choler is aſſwaged. In which Phyſicians may eaſily erre and be deceived, who are ignorant of the bilious humor lurking in the lungs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſpettle, though it appear yellow, pale, or ruddy, they obſerve not whether it be ſharp or bitter. Yet in thoſe ſick perſons, the lungs being conſumed, ſpettle bloudy or purulent is after expelled, and ſo they pine away. Of theſe <hi>Galen ſpeaks</hi> 4. <hi>of affected places, cha.</hi> 9. in a context worthy notice, and ſo much conducing to this thing, that his words may deſervedly be transferred to this place. <hi>One,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuddenly ſpet forth humor in colour much reſembling liquid choler, viz. communicating of yellow and pale, and tainted with no acrimony, and ſo did daily ſend forth by ſpettle a greater quantity of it; afterward upon the ſurpriſal of a ſlight Feaver, he begin to pine, ſo that he expelled purulent matter by excreation. After in ſome ſpace of time, viz. of four months, he caſt out ſmall quantity of bloud with purulent matter, and ſo was more waſted with an acute Feaver, and often and again ſpet more, ſo that the ſpettle increaſed to a great quantity: the Feaver therefore more increaſing, and the ſtrength being debilitated, he dyed like thoſe who pine. Again I ſaw another
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:153522:103"/>troubled with the ſame diſeaſe ſix months, and another longer. The firſt ſeemed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be not very badly affected, but afterwards dangerouſly. But when we ſaw the other, we preſently upon the beginning of the diſeaſe knowing the evil, endeavoured by a preſent medicine to afford help; and much more to the third. But though we took much pains to free both, yet no one could preſerve either of theſe; for being now approximated to death, they ſpet forth putrid parts of their lungs.</hi> Thus <hi>Galen;</hi> but it affords cauſe of wonder, that upon the appearance of yellow or pale ſpettle, vacant of any ſharp, bitter, or ſalt taſt, men ſhould be reduced to pining. But this is cauſed, for that by the mixtion of pituitous humor the taſt in ſuch ſpettle is rather occult then the heat; which flegme is contained in the pipes of the lungs, and is there mingled with choler, but choler ſo ſharp and copious is gathered in the lungs, that by it they conſume, putrifie, and pine away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After ſpetting of bloud follows ſpetting of purulent matter; after ſpetting of that, pining; but upon ſuppreſſion of ſpetting the ſick perſons die.</hi> Aph. 15. and 16. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>Spetting of purulent matter is not the neceſſary ſequel of ſpetting bloud: for bloud often flows from the brains, gums, and throat without any detriment. So neither doth ſpetting purulent matter by the law of neceſſity attend that ſpetting of bloud which happens in a pleurifie and peripneumony; but this aphoriſme is to be underſtood of that ſpetting of bloud onely which proceeds from the lungs, by the eroſion of that part, or the ruption of ſome vein diſperſed through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof: for ſpetting of purulent matter, pining, and death, are the nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary conſequents of this ſpetting of bloud. But this ſpettle for that it degenerates into purulent ſpettle, is diſtinguiſhed from the before mentioned, becauſe in it the ſpumous and very florid bloud is by cough expelled; all which conditions are not found in the other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The green, eruginous, ſignifie an high inflammation of heat, and plenty of eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous choler. The pale is cauſed either by black choler, or extinction of heat. Black proceeds from the ſame cauſes, but much more powerful: for both a greater aduſtion, and refrigeration, or extinction of he at produceth out of pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs blackneſs. That ſpettle is termed ſincere which proceeds from one humor, pure, and impermixt, and deſtitute of its ſerum, which ſerum is by heat conſumed. The ſetid ſignifies a great putridity overſpreading the ſpirital parts: That therfore al theſe kinds of ſpettle are very bad, the cauſes now recited do ſufficiently convince.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe it diſcovers a great inflammation and heat raked up within, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſates that matter, and makes it viſcid, ſo that it cannot eaſily be purged, and not without a moleſtious cough, and troubleſome excreation, which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental then beneficial.</p>

                        <hi>Viſcid and glutinous ſpettle, with hoarſneſs, is very bad.</hi> 1. Coac. ch. 16.</p>
                     <p>Spettle ſimply viſcid and glutinous is bad, as appeared by the <hi>precedent theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem:</hi> but if this ſpettle induce hoarſneſs, it ſhews that acrimony is joyned with viſcidity, which by exaſperating the artery cauſeth hoarſneſs. The worſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter is the worſe affects it produceth: and ſo whatever pleuritical and peripneumonical perſons expel ſuch ſpettle with hoarſneſs, they are affected with a deadly diſeaſe. But in others free from ſuch affections, ſuch ſpettle with hoarſneſs, glutinous, and ſalſuginous. preſage aphthiſis.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For firſt round ſpettle is neceſſarily craſs and viſcid, and ſo, as we obſerved, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: yea it argues incoctible matter, which by a combuſtion being made too craſs and viſcid, is ſhaped into ſuch a forme. Therefore whatever pleuritical
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:153522:103"/>or peripneumonical perſons eject ſuch ſpettle, do ſoon after dy. So likewiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſeaſe ſuch ſpettle demonſtrates a phthiſis, by the teſtimony of <hi>Galen, comm. in</hi> 6. <hi>Epid.</hi> Where he relates, that he ſaw in ſome perſons free from any Feaver, ſuch ſpettle, who in a long time ſeemed not to be affected, yet all of them after pined away with a phthiſis: but that ſpettle which reſembles the corns of hail, becauſe it is round, is of a more ſolid confiſtence, and proceeds from a greater heat of the lungs, and ſo is a more certain demonſtration of a phthiſis. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places, cha.</hi> 9. ſhews the danger of this ſpettle in a remarkable ſtory, in theſe words. <hi>Beſides I have obſerved another ſuch like affection in the lungs: one troubled with a long cough, and ſpetting a ſmall quantity of clammy purulent matter, expelled a fragment not unlike a little corn of hail, and bringing it to me ſhewed me it; and again not long after he brought another; whence he did conjecture that that clammy humor which he before uſually ſpet forth was dryed and indurated to ſuch a ſubſtance. I therefore gave him a medicine in his drink, which is helpful to aſthmatical perſons, and ſo it happened that he expelled leſſer hail, after a longer interval then heretofore; nor could the affection in many years after be ſo mitigated but that at laſt he died. But this for the moſt part did in magnitude equalize vetches, though ſometimes they ſeemed leſſer, ſometimes bigger. And ſo we have ſeen others to ſpet the like, who yet have lived many years after, ſome of which flied upon ſome other cauſe; others by the affection of their ſpiritual inſtruments, though they ſent forth no bloud.</hi>

                     <p>Froth. <hi>Perſons choked, lying in a deliquium, yet not dead, cannot be revived, if froth appear about their mouth.</hi> Aph. 43. Sect. 2.</p>
                     <p>Froth owes its production either to vehement heat exciting many vapors, and mingling them with the ſaliva, as may be ſeen in things put to the fire, which boyl, and by ebullition ſend forth a ſpume; or it is cauſed by violent motion, which in the ſame manner confuſeth flatulency with the watry ſubſtance; as is evident in the white of an egge upon long agitation, and in the ſea by the vehement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of wind. They therefore who are inflamed by vehement anger, running, or violent exercitation, may have froth in their mouth without any danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceeds from a procatarctick cauſe. So likewiſe epileptical perſons about the end of acceſſion eject froth at their mouth, by reaſon of that violent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſory motion which by exagitation attenuates and diſſolves that pituitous matter contained in the brain, by which the paroxyſme was excited; therefore there is no danger in that neither, becauſe it is the conſequence of the excluſion of morbifick matter. But in thoſe who are choked, whether by hanging, or drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a troubleſome quinſie, or apoplexy, froth appearing in the mouth is a very bad ſigne, and denotes a proximity of death; for it ſignifies the laſt ſtruggling of nature, endeavouring by main ſtrength to exclude the vapors contained in the lungs, with which it alſo forceth out ſome of the proper humidity of the lungs, and mingles it with the mentioned vapors.</p>

                     <p>For the morbifick matter is revulſed into the contrary part, and this revulſion ſignifies a refreſhing of nature, and reſumption of ſtrength. For as a Phyſician labours the retreat of thoſe things which flow into any part; ſo nature, when ſhe begins to prevail cauſeth this recoile; as when upon ſurdity ſhe cauſeth bilious dejections, ſo upon a flux of the belly ſhe converts to vomiting.

And this <hi>Hipp. in his Aph.</hi> mentions; as alſo he ſpeaks of bloud ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by a cough, which is raiſed from the breaſt or lungs. Yet <hi>note,</hi> that ſome times bloudy vomiting is good and healthy, if it be critically performed, though this happens very ſeldome; yet <hi>Galen</hi> averres it, 7. <hi>Meth. chap.</hi> 11.3. <hi>of cauſe of ſympt. chap.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 5. <hi>of affected places chap.</hi> 7. and we have ſeen ſometimes a pleuriſie in a ſtrong young man to have been perfectly and healthfully judged by vomiting bloud on the ſeventh day. We alſo ſaw another who after a tedious ſickneſs, being as it were pained with difficulty of ſpiration, upon a ſudden emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of black bloud by copious vomits was freed. This aphoriſme therefore muſt be underſtood with this diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> that the perſevering and often repeated vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of bloud is bad: but if it happen once, and return again, and if the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any diſeaſe follow it, it is undoubtedly good.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For it is not convenient that any thing decretory ſhould be ſparingly expelled; but ſuch vacuations ſignifie either ſuch a plenty of matter that nature cannot bear it, but expelleth ſome of it ſymptomatically; or the imbecillity of nature, in vain endeavouring to remove ſuperfluities.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For ſuch vomit ſignifies that porraceous, eruginous, or black choler are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the body. But all theſe ſpecies of choler do uſually produce malignant and deadly diſeaſes: but if a ſtink be joyned to them, they ſignifie a notable corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors, which will ſoon poyſon nature.

We <hi>muſt anſwer,</hi> that that diſeaſe was ſo dangerous, and attended by ſuch deſperate ſymptomes, that it was a wonder how the ſick party ſhould eſcape, when it had held her eighty dayes. But it ſometimes happens that ſome even moſt deadly diſeaſes are beyond all hope of the Phyſician brought to an happy concluſion, which yet do not debilitate the judgements of art, which imply a common, though not alwaies a neceſſary conſequence. Beſides this it is worth animadverſion, that ſuch depraved humors are ſometimes Critically expelled, though this be a rare accident. Laſtly, of ſtinking vomit with a train of other bad qualities, we have an inſtance in 3 <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 12.

                     </p>
                     <p>For ſincere humor is not crude onely, but alſo incoctile, as excluding as well the act as the power of coction. <hi>Hipp.</hi> termes every humor void of mixtion, or all fervid and crude excrement not tempered with its ſerum, <hi>impermixt.</hi> Whoſe generation proceeds from the vitioſity of ſome part, or from heat and febrile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, the aquous and ſerous part being exhauſted; therefore in an acute Feaver it ſhews that a great inflammation is fuelled within, and moſt commonly by nature invincible.</p>

                        <hi>In any diſeaſe if black choler be upward or downward evacuated, it is deadly.</hi> Aph. 22. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>Such excretion is deadly as a ſigne, and as a cauſe; for no excretion in the cradle of a diſeaſe can be healthful, and evacuation of any humor is bad before the ſignes of concoction. For this demonſtrates that the cauſe is very biting and troubleſome, or that the faculty is wholly languid when the oeconomy of nature is thus diſturbed, which concocts firſt, then ſegregates, and parts the uſeful from the uſeleſs, laſtly expels. But when the peccant matter in this manner diſturbing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very bad, we muſt think the ſick perſon is deadly affected. But if in the progreſs of the diſeaſe black choler be expelled, the evacuation of it may be ſometimes good, <hi>viz.</hi> if the ſignes of concoction appear with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They who are extenuated by acute or long diſeaſes, or wounds, or by any other means, if they evacuate black choler, or as it were black bloud through their inferiors, they die the day following.</hi> Aph. 23. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>Extenuation ſignifies great debility, ſuch dejection denotes a great diſeaſe, which ſoon deſtroyes the ſick perſon ſo very infirme. When therefore ſuch an evacuation happens to perſons ſo extenuated, it ſignifies that nature now quite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled cannot any longer contain thoſe humors, but ſets them at liberty, and excludes them through the inferiors.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fat dejections in acute diſeaſes are cauſed, according to <hi>Gal. comm. in text.</hi> 22. <hi>hock</hi> 2. <hi>prorrh.</hi> as often as the fat is melted by fiery heat. But when they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcous alſo, they ſignifie not onely a colliquation of the fat, but alſo of the ſolid parts of the body, whence they neceſſarily pine. But becauſe fat and viſcid dejections are ſometimes generated by fat and clammy aliments, as alſo by flegme made viſcid by much heat, they are ſo to be diſtinguiſhed; that thoſe which proceed from aliment or flegme are more copious, and ſtink not; but thoſe cauſed by colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation are few, and very fetid, and as <hi>Galen</hi> will have it, ſtink is the chief ſign of colliquation. Theſe fat dejections therefore ſignifie a great inflammation, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſtruction, if they be attended with any bad ſignes, and the more if the diſeaſe be great and vehement; as in a more gentle diſeaſe they preſage diuturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtead of deſtruction, ſuch as <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved in him who dwelt in <hi>Dealces</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, of whom he ſaith, that on the ſixth day his dejections were black, fat, ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, viſcous and fetid, who was not judged before the fourtieth day. But they proceeded not from the colliquation of the ſolid parts, but from fat and viſcid numors putrified, for they were many. But theſe which are cauſed upon the pining of the ſolid ſubſtance of the parts are wholly exitial, ſuch as <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved in <hi>Silenus;</hi> as we noted in the <hi>precedent Theorem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spumous dejections in acute Feavers are bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they denote either an inflammation of heat, by which the boyling excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contract a ſpume, as we ſee in a kettle by the force of heat; or that flatuous ſpirits are mingled with humor, as appears in the forth of the ſea upon an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of windes: but both is bad, becauſe the one argues a melting heat, the other an unequal perturbation. Yet they are worſe which denote a melting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of heat, and they are known by an acute feaver, and expulſion of ſpumous excrements ſomewhat hot, as alſo becauſe they are ſincere. Of theſe we may read <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>Prorrhet. A ſpumous effloreſcence in bilious and ſincere dejections is bad.</hi> But thoſe which proceed from the commixtion of flatuous ſpirit are alſo bad, becauſe they declare a crudity in the excrements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In acute diſeaſes, if things aſſumed be caſt forth unaltered, it is deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such a lienteria ſhews that the natural functions in the ventricle are aboliſhed by the very great exolution of native heat, which denounces the proximity of death, as appears in <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 15. in the wife of <hi>Dealces,</hi> to whom on the ſeventeenth day happened a turbulent irritation in her belly, after her very drink flowed from her, and on the twentieth day ſhe died.</p>
                     <p>Wormes. <hi>In the beginning of a diſeaſe if wormes creep forth it is bad, either alive or dead, chiefly if they come unattended with feculency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For alive they ſignifie a very great crudity, or penury of aliment; and dead, they denote great putridity by which they are killed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wormes in the declination of a diſeaſe, expelled with excrements, and upon appearance of concoction, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this ſhews that nature hath power over the excrements.</p>
                     <p>Quantity. <hi>Dejections of the belly in any diſeaſe too copious are bad. But if when they be expelled the belly do ſomething ſwell and increaſe, they are very bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Too copious a flux of the belly doth much reſolve the ſtrength and debilitate nature, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> mentions <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>progn.</hi> But if there be an univerſal and frequent dejection, it imminently endangers a defection of life: which he alſo confirmes <hi>in Coac. prenot.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>A liquid dejection, and flowing out copiouſly, and at once,</hi>

                     <p>For we have ſhewn in another place that all evacuations that proceed in a little quantity, are of ſmall moment, both becauſe they do not ſuffice to take away the cauſe of the diſeaſe, as alſo becauſe they ſignifie either a great multitude of humors oppreſſing the ſtrength of nature, or elſe a great weakneſs of nature it ſelf. Beſides, if a looſneſs do ſtop as ſoon asit begins, it ſhews that the evil humors which began their courſe through the guts, are turned another way, where they may do more miſchief. Of theſe ſpeaketh <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in theſe words <hi>in</hi> 7. <hi>Epid. The bellies though by chance they were looſened, yet preſently were perniciouſly bound up.</hi> Hence it proceeds, that thoſe fluxes and dyſenteries which are ſuddenly ſtopped, are wont very much to endanger the life of the patient.</p>
                     <p>The Quality. <hi>A watry looſneſs which begins with an acute diſeaſe, and tarries with it, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies an abundance of the matter cauſing the diſeaſe, or the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality thereof, which forceth nature to ſuch an immature, and unſeaſonable flux. Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 8. of a young man whoſe belly flowed the firſt day with much cholerick and thin matter: the ſecond day ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a greater flux of matter more indigeſted, and the ſeventh day he dyed. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 10. <hi>the ſame Sect.</hi> he ſpeaks of a woman whoſe belly flowed the firſt day with much thin and crude matter: the ſecond day with much more of the ſame, and the ſeventh day ſhe dyed: her belly remaining moiſt with much thin and undigeſted matter all the while.</p>

                        <hi>A looſneſs of the belly happening to one taken with a pleuriſie, or a peripneumony, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs, is an evil ſymptome.</hi> Aph. 1. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>For when the organs ſerving for reſpiration are vehemently afflicted, the liver and the ſtomach are thereby alſo ſtrongly affected: ſo that they being weakened there follows a looſneſs of the belly, which for that reaſon uſes to be mortal. Therefore to make good this ſymptome, the pleuriſie or inflammation of the lungs ought to be exceeding vehement; which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to intimate, as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves in his Comment upon this Aphoriſm, who doth not ſimply ſay that a looſneſs is evil in a Pleuriſie, or inflammation of the lungs, but addes the words, <hi>being vehemently taken with;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, that a looſneſs of the belly ſeiſing upon a perſon detained and vexed with ſuch diſeaſes, was an evil ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome. Becauſe a looſeneſs of the belly happens to ſuch men through a weakneſs of the liver, that is not able to draw the nouriſhment to it, nor to turn it into blood, the ſtomach alſo oftentimes corrupting the ſaid n ouriſhment; but in a moderate pleuriſie, or inflammation of the lungs when a looſneſes doth happen, it may profit much by way of evacuation, ſpecially if the diſeaſe be ſo gentle, that there is no great fear of any danger, alſo if there do appear certain ſignes of concoction both in the urine and ſpettle. Sometimes alſo at the beginning of a pleuriſie or inflammation of the lungs, the foreſaid matter diverts it ſelf to the guts, and cauſes a wholeſome and ſeaſonable flux.</p>

                     <p>By ſuch a flux of the belly in this caſe the humor is drawn down to the moſt diſtant oppoſite parts, and from the upper parts to the lower; which is therefore of all things the moſt efficacious and profitable.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>All concoction is perfected by thickening, and thoſe things which are concocted become more thick; and therefore excrements which at firſt being thin and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, do afterwards grow thick by degrees, do ſhew that nature is ſtrong that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms her work ſo well.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the fluxes of white matter are cauſed by undigeſted meats, as white bread, milke, Ptiſſan, or unhuſked Barly, Rice, Almonds, and ſuch like: or as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth <hi>in</hi> 2 <hi>Progn.</hi> when the choler can by no means come to the inteſtines; which happens either through an obſtruction of that pipe which conveyes it from the bladder of the Gall to the Guts, as comes to paſs in the yellow jaundiſe; or becauſe that the Choler is drawn upward with the blood by the heat of the head which is inflamed: or laſtly, thoſe white fluxes are cauſed by a melting of ſome ſoft and new made fat. But theſe are few, ſlimie, and of an evil ſavour. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they happen, unleſs it be thoſe that take the white colour from the colour of the meat, in acute diſeaſes they are not a little to be condemned, but moſt of all thoſe which happen when the brain is inflamed: of which <hi>Hippocrates in Pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhet.</hi> In thoſe who are phrenetick a white flux is naught, becauſe all the choler is then drawn up into the brain. Moreover, in cholerick feavers white fluxes are evil, becauſe the excrements ought to anſwer to the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and therefore they ſignifie either an obſtruction of the pipe through which the choler paſſeth to the guts; which obſtruction for the moſt part is mortal to ſuch as are not in feavers; of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks <hi>in Coac. Perſons troubled with the Kings evil, whoſe feculencies flow forth in a great quantity dye, and in them a white flux pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds:</hi> Or it ſignifies an inflammation of the brain, and the upper convex part of the Liver, which draws all the choler to them. Laſtly, we have ſhewn that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſlimy, and ill-ſmelling fluxes are evil, becauſe they denote a miſchievous col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation or melting of the fat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vitelline, eruginous, green, pale, black, variouſly coloured, or very ill-ſavoured fluxes are evil.</hi> 2. progn.</p>
                     <p>All theſe fluxes are evil for the ſame reaſons which we have above rehearſed. Yet ſometimes they may be caſt forth critically and advantageouſly, if in the urine there do appear the ſignes of concoction; as you may ſee in <hi>Hippocrates, in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.

Her ſleep was little, her urine well coloured, but thin to the end. The fluxes of her belly cholerick, acrimonious, very little, and thoſe black, and ill ſmelling: a ſmooth and white ſediment was in her urine; ſhe ſweat, and upon the eleventh day the criſis was perfectly made.</p>
                     <p>The manner of excretion. <hi>Liquid excrements of the belly with pain, and a dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or a laborious and frequent dejection, are evil.</hi>

                     <p>For they ſignifie a very great ſharpneſs of the humours, which gripes, prickes, and gnaws the guts exceedingly.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A liquid flux which imperceptibly flows from the body, is very dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For either it ſignifies a depravation of the ſenſes, and madneſs, or a diſſolution of the natural heat, which is preſently followed by an aboliſhment of the ſenſes.</p>

                        <hi>A flux of the belly which may be eaſily endured, and which gives any eaſe to the patient, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhewes that nature doth expell the noxious humors, and that a diſſolution of the diſeaſe is nigh at hand.</p>
                     <p>By the bladder] <hi>That urine is the beſt which is of a moderate ſubſtance, anſwering the quantity of drink taken, of a colour inclining either to red or yellow, with a white ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſmooth and equal.</hi> Gal. 1. de Criſ. chap. 12.</p>
                     <p>That all the vices of urine may be the more eaſily diſcerned, it will be requiſite in the firſt place to ſet forth all the conditions of a good and ſound urine, that this Theorem may be a rule, whereto to reduce all thoſe that follow. Therefore a good urine ought to be of a middling ſubſtance, that is, neither too thick nor too thin, of a colour inclining to red or yellow; for ſome urines are more, others leſs coloured, and yet well concocted, which uſes to proceed from the ſeveral diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of bodies, that is to ſay, from the temper of the liver and other principal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, as alſo from the age, ſex, diet, and manner of living of ſeveral perſons. For hotter bodies have urine more coloured, and cold ones more pale. Young men have urines thinnes and higher coloured then thoſe of children, children have thicker, and old men thinner and leſs coloured. The urines of women are thicker then thoſe of men, and leſs coloured, with much ſediment. And thoſe that indulge to their appetites make water with much raw ſediment, and thoſe that ſuffer hunger, watching and labour, make water of a higher colour, with leſs ſediment. On the other ſide, thoſe that live at eaſe have urines leſs coloured with much ſediment. But in well tempered bodies that urine will be beſt, which, a <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, inclines a little to the colour of ſaffron; and thoſe other differences that come neareſt to this are to be accounted beſt: but in diſeaſes it ſuffices to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticate a recovery, if that the urine enjoy as near as may be thoſe properties which it had when the patient was in health: and therefore it would avail much to have obſerved the urine when the patient was in health, that you may thereby know how much it is fallen from its natural condition. Laſtly, the ſediment ought to be white, ſmooth, and even; which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirms, 2. <hi>progn. text.</hi> 26. and he addes, that this ſediment ought to remain all the while till perfect judgement be made of the diſeaſe: for if it do intermit, and that ſometimes the water be made without any ſediment, it portends that the diſeaſe will be longer and leſs ſafe. But here it is to be <hi>noted,</hi> that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the forecited place onely looks at the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:153522:110"/>ſediment by which the concoction may be judged of; not at the ſubſtance or colour, for that varies in every individual. And for that alſo becauſe a urine which hath an excellent ſediment &amp; a excellent color, muſt of neceſſity have a middling ſubſtance, therefore that ſediment which ſettles at the bottome of the chamberpot, white, ſmooth, &amp; equal, like well concocted purulency, is a ſigne of perfect concoction. That <hi>enaeorema</hi> which appears hanging in the middle of the urinal or chamberpot, is leſs commendable, and ſignifies a more imperfect concoction. But the cloud that ſwims at the top of the urine, deſerves yet a leſs commendation. Although as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> both that which appears in the middle, as alſo the cloud, ſo they be good, are ſometimes ſufficient for the foretelling of health; which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> doth expreſly ſay, <hi>Aph.</hi> 71. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Where the judgement of the diſeaſe is made the ſeventh day, there appears in the urine of ſuch perſons a little red cloud on the fourth day.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Galen in his commentaries,</hi> not onely the appearing of a red cloud not ſeen before ſignifies judication, but alſo of a white cloud much more; but that which hangs in the middle being white, equal, and conſiſtent, is better then either of them.</p>
                     <p>The liquidneſs of urine, and its qualities.] <hi>Thin urines, of a good colour, in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are wholeſome.</hi>

                     <p>Of theſe ſpeaketh <hi>Galen Comment. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.</hi> in theſe words; <hi>certain therefore it is, that thin urines, if ſo be they are of a good colour, by reaſon of the goodneſs of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, do promiſe health, but whereas they were thin, they required onely time for concoction.</hi> Tis true theſe urines do portend health, but not ſuddenly enſuing; which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> obſerved <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 6. in a patient named <hi>Cleonactides.</hi> This man upon the ſixtieth day made a thin water, but of a good colour: on the eighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day a perfect judgement was made of the diſeaſe. Alſo <hi>Aegr.</hi> 10. <hi>of the ſame ſection. Clazomenius</hi> from the beginning of his diſeaſe unto the ſixteenth day made a thin water, but of a good colour, with much diſperſed matter hanging in the middle thereof, without any ſettlement, and the fourtieth day he recovered. So the 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 9. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 5. <hi>Chaerion</hi> made a thin water, but of a good colour to the end, having a kind of clammy <hi>enaeorema</hi> hanging in the middle, and on the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day perfect judgement was made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Urines thin, white, and watry, in a difficult diſeaſe are pernicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For either theſe urines do ſhew the cholerick matter to be carried up into the head, whence ariſes phrenſie and madneſs, of which <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Where the urine appears white and perſpicuous, it is dangerous, eſpecially if it come from ſuch as are in a Phrenſie.</hi> But <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith <hi>in his comment.</hi> That he never ſaw any phrenitick perſon ſaved who made ſuch water. Or they ſignifie very great crudities, which portend either death or a long diſeaſe, for nature requires a long time to expel that extreme cruditie. And therefore if the Feaver be not very vehement and acute, and the ſtrength of the body not waſted, the health of the perſon is many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, though it be a good while firſt. But in a vehement diſeaſe, and where the ſtrength is decayed, ſuch urines are altogether pernicious. But thoſe urines do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally denote deſtruction, which come after the beginning of the diſeaſe, and continue long, ſuch as were thoſe that appeared in a certain woman, who on the eleventh day made thin and watry urines, which continued ſo to the fourtieth day; but if after the judgement of the diſeaſe be made, thoſe urines do ſtill continue, it is a certain ſigne of relapſe. In other diſeaſes, as intermitting Feavers, or gentle and diuturnal, a thin urine denotes great obſtructions of the milt, liver, meſentery, and other like parts, through which the urine being ſtreined becomes ſo thin and watry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe urines which are thick, full of humors, little in quantity, not without a Feaver, if they come thin from ſuch perſons in good quantity, tis helpful, But theſe chiefly are ſuch
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:153522:110"/>which have a ſediment at the beginning, or preſently after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>thick</hi> urines are to be underſtood ſuch urines as either are very craſs, or are alwaies troubled or muddy; by <hi>grumous</hi> urines, ſuch as have many clods or lumps in them. Such urines are made at the beginning of Feavers proceeding from flegme: for thickneſs comes from the multitude of thick humors; the lumps in urine are cauſed by certain bits of flegme dryed by the heat of the Feaver: theſe urines are then made <hi>in little quantity,</hi> becauſe nature is then imployed to retain it: but when the humor is concocted the urine appears thinner, that perturbation ceaſing, and it comes forth in greater quantity, becauſe nature now endeavours an evacuation; and by how much the more plentifully it is evacuated, by ſo much the more it helps, as in all critical evacuations. Therefore in this place that is called <hi>thin urine,</hi> not which is ſo indeed, for that avails not; but that whoſe muddy diſtemper is taken away by concoction: Theſe are chiefly made in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers proceeding from flegm, in which the urines are wont at the beginning to have a certain deceitful ſediment, which is not made by concoction, but by the deſcending downward of raw humors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That urine which comes from the body thick, muddy, and troubled, but becomes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it ſelf cleare and limpid, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it portends the victory of nature ſeparating things hererogeneous, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that which is injurious to her, and that ſo much the more, if after this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the thicker part ſettle in the bottome white, ſmooth, and equal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Urine which at firſt comes forth clear, but after ſome time becomes muddy, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies that nature hath begun a concoction, and made a notable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A thick muddy urine, which ſo remains, that being put to the fire will not clear up, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſuch urine, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth <hi>in Aph.</hi> 70. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. if the ſtrength of the body be accordingly, ſhews that the diſeaſe will be long; if the ſtrength be diminiſhed it portends the death of the patient: for it is cauſed by a multitude of thick and crude humors, with which much winde being mixed, the urine is thereby agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and troubled; ſo that if the ſtrength be waſted, there is great danger leſt it be ſuffocated by the abundance of ſuch humors; but if there be ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, much time is required to diſcuſs thoſe humors. There is an example of this urine in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 4. in the wife of <hi>Philinus,</hi> who made much water the eleventh day with convulſions, which ſeldome bring along with them white or thick urine, as in thoſe waters which ſettle, when being ſet aſide for a good while, they perſiſted muddy without ſettling; the colour and thickneſs of the urine being like that of cattel; on the twentieth day ſhe died. Alſo <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. <hi>of the ſame Section,</hi> in the wife of <hi>Dromeada;</hi> the ſecond day ſhe made a thick white and troubled urine, like to thoſe which have a ſettlement, when after they have been ſet aſide for ſome time they become muddy; yet her urine ſettled not; on the ſixth day ſhe died: ſo alſo in <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> and in another that in a hot ſit eat and drank largely, the ſame troubled and unſettled urines were obſerved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Urines that come forth muddy, and remain ſo with an evil ſmell, are very evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie a Gangrene in the bladder or the parts adjoyning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Red urine, or yellow and thin, and ſo continuing long, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews an extraordinary heat and inflaming diſpoſition in the liver, or ſtomach, or midriffe, by which no concoction but rather an aduſtion or ſcorching of the humors is cauſed. And therefore ſuch a kind of urine perſevering, if the body be weak, portends death; but if the body be in ſtrength, it ſignifies a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153522:111"/>of the diſeaſe, or a diverſion of the humor into the lower parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Black urines appearing in an acute diſeaſe are pernicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie an extraordinary ſcorching up of the humors, cauſing them to degenerate into melancholy, which produces deadly affections; as may be ſeen in <hi>Philiſcus,</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.

Which is confirmed by the ſtory of <hi>Silenus in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.</hi> when his urine had continued black unto the fourth day, in the fifth day it began to come forth thin and tranſparent. And <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. of a woman that lay ſick at the cold water, and dyed the eightieth day. On the eleventh day ſhe made <hi>much thin and black water,</hi> and on the twentieth <hi>much watry urine.</hi> Which <hi>Galen</hi> obſerved <hi>in his comm. viz.</hi> that black urines turned into watry are mortal. Laſtly, worſt of all are the black urines with a black ſediment, of which <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>de Criſ. Cap.</hi> 12. thus diſcourſes; <hi>worſt of all is that urine which is totally black, ſo that I have ſeen no man eſcape that ever made ſuch water: yet it is leſs pernicious if the ſediment be only black; and ſtill leſs dangerous, if onely that which is in the middle be black; and much leſs it is to be feared, if the cloud appears onely of that colour.</hi> Yet here it is to be noted, that black urines are not alwaies evil; For firſt, in melancholy perſons ſuch urines may be critically made. As <hi>Galen in comment. in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>text.</hi> 74. relates, that he knew a certain woman who was much helped by the evacuation of ſuch waters. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in ſplenetick perſons black urines may be ſafely voided, that is when the ſpleen empties it ſelf through thoſe parts, as happened to <hi>Herophon in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 3. who being oppreſſed with an acute Feaver, from the beginning to the fifth day made black and thin water; the fifth day his milt ſwelled, the eighth day the ſwelling ceaſed, his urine was more coloured, and had a little ſettlement: the ſeventeenth, the diſeaſe had a proſperous judgement. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> urines of this nature being joyned with an efflux of blood from the noſe are leſs dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thinner and hotter parts of the blood wherein the danger lay, is voided by bleeding, as you may ſee <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 7. where <hi>Meto</hi> being taken with a Feaver, the fourth day there flowed out of his right noſtril a little blood twice; his urine was blackiſh, having a blackiſh matter hanging in the middle, diſperſed, without ſettlement; the fifth day clear blood flowed more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly out of the left noſtril, he ſweat, was judged. After the Criſis he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and talked idle, making thin and blackiſh water, he ſlept and came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his fit returned not, but he bled often, and that after the Criſis. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> black urine appearing upon a ſuppreſſion of the months, when they flow copiouſly, they cauſe a ſolution of the diſeaſe, as for example, in 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. where mention is made of a woman, of whom judgment was made the third day of that made thin and black water, but at the time of the Criſis, her courſes deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very plentifully.</p>
                     <p>The Quality. <hi>Much urine and well concocted upon the decretory day, are good.</hi>

                     <p>For they ſhew that the matter cauſing the diſeaſe is overcome by nature, and is conveniently expelled through the proper places. Such urines <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerved in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> of whom he ſaith; that <hi>on the twenty fourth day he made much white water, wherein was much ſediment, and was judged with ſweating:</hi> and of <hi>Pericles</hi> the ſame <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſpeaks, that <hi>the third day the Feaver was aſſwaged, much concocted urine appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which was much ſediment;</hi> then alſo he ſaith that <hi>Chaerion</hi> was ſaved by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much bilious urine.</p>

                        <hi>Much urine, thin and watry, without any contents in it, profit nothing, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they proceed from a multitude of excrementitious and crude humors, or from a hot diſtemper of the kidneys, which is thought to cauſe a diabete: or from a colliquation of the whole body, whence proceeds a great diſſolution of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat. So 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 12. a certain woman on the eighth day made much water without any profit or amendment, and the fourteenth day died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Little urine and thin, not anſwering to the quantity of drink taken in any diſeaſe, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews a weakneſs of the ſeparating and expulſive faculty, or an intenſe heat parching up the moiſture of the body; as appeared in the wife of <hi>Dromeada,</hi> and in the youth of <hi>Metibza,</hi> and in the daughter of <hi>Euryanactes,</hi> and in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that lay ill at the houſe of <hi>Piſamenus,</hi> and in her that lay ill at the houſe of <hi>Pantimedes;</hi> all which perſons made thin and little water, and ſoon afterwards died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stoppage of the urine in acute diſeaſes is pernicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the ſuppreſſion of urine in acute diſeaſes, as <hi>Galen.</hi> teaches <hi>in his comment in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid.</hi> is cauſed either by a fiery heat conſuming the ſerous humors of the bloud; or by an extinction of the natural functions; as happened to <hi>Silenus,</hi> whoſe urine ſtopped the fixth day, the ſeventh day he made no water, and the eleventh day he dyed. Alſo in a woman that lay ſick of a quinſie in the houſe of <hi>Oſiton</hi> at <hi>Cizicum,</hi> and a youth of <hi>Morlibia,</hi> whoſe urine ſtopped a little before their death. But that is the worſt ſuppreſſion of the urine that follows a coldneſs of the body, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teacheth 1. <hi>Coac. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 5. after coldneſs pernicious <hi>is that ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the urine that precedes a coldneſs of the body,</hi> becauſe it ſignifies a critical eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, which will be accompliſhed, eſpecially by ſweating. So on the other ſide, it is worſt of all when it follows that coldneſs, becauſe it ſhews that the action of the bladder is totally deſtroyed, and that the heat thereof is extinguiſhed by that perfrigeration.</p>
                     <p>The contents, the urine. <hi>Urines that have either ſediment or matter hanging in the middle, nor cloud, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe urines wanting content are evil, if it be not cauſed by famine, labour, or watching, or a nephritical diſpoſition of the reins, or that the bodies were not very cholerick. For they ſignifie great crudity of humors, or concoction of them, or weakneſs of the bowels, or inflammation of them, or elſe vehement obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Urines that have little ſediment are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They indeed are leſs evil then thoſe that have no contents, becauſe they proceed from the ſame, though from leſſer cauſes: of theſe ſpeaks <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Thin urine and unconcocted, diſcoloured, and little, or having thickneſs, and few ſediments, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſediments that appear like meal are evil, thoſe that appear like ſlates are worſe, but thoſe that ſeem like bran are worſt of all.</hi> Hipp. 2. prog.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of ſettlements, according to <hi>Galen.</hi> 1. <hi>of Crit. chap.</hi> 12. are cauſed by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:153522:112"/>an immenſe heat melting and burning the fat, and the very ſubſtance of the fleſh. But when this burning heat preys upon the ſolid parts, firſt it aſſails the more ſoft and newly ſubſtantiated fat, afterwards the more ſolid; and when all the fat is melted and conſumed, then it falls upon the more tender and newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted fleſh, after that upon the more ſolid fleſh, and laſtly upon the moſt ſolid parts themſelves. By the new fat thus melted by the heat of the Feaver, are cauſed oyly urines. But by the more ſolid fat being melted, as alſo from the fleſh raggedly diſſolved, and likewiſe from thick blood parched are cauſed thoſe ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſembling <hi>meal,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth <hi>in comment of this Prognoſtick.</hi> From the ſolid parts unequally diſſolved proceed thoſe ſediments which are like ſlates, as alſo thoſe reſembling bran, when the heat is more intenſe; whence it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>ſlaty</hi> ſediments are worſe then the <hi>mealie</hi> ones, and the <hi>brannie</hi> ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worſe then the <hi>ſlaty:</hi> how pernicious thoſe ſediments are will appear by the judgement of <hi>Galen,</hi> of that reſembling meale which is not ſo bad as the reſt; <hi>in Com. in Aph.</hi> 31. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. he thus writes; <hi>ſuch urines are mortal, as alſo is ſaid in the Prognoſt. and many are killed in a ſhort time of ſickneſs, and who ever of them eſcape they have a long time of ſickneſs, the diſpoſition requiring a great concoction where ſuch water is made.</hi> So <hi>Hipp. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Aegr.</hi> 2. alſo declares. His urine was copious, the ſediment was thick, a white ſediment like thick flour white, his extreme parts were cold, and on the eleventh day he dyed. But <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 3. he ſaith of the man that lay in the garden of <hi>Dealces, his urines were thin,</hi> variouſly coloured, having various ſediments like thick flour. This man he relates to have been judged on the fourtieth day. It is therefore manifeſt by theſe examples, that whoever they be that void urine like to a thicker ſort of meal, if they may be ſaved, yet it is long before they eſcape. But whoever they are that are thus mortally affected, they periſh immediately: Thoſe are floury urines in which the ſediment appears at the bottome of the urine like purulency, and they are very dangerous, as I have often experienced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſhattered and unequal ſediment in the urine is naught.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies crudity, which if it remain in the ſame condition, ſo that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment do not change for the better, in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, it ſhews that nature cannot overcome the matter cauſing the diſeaſe; but if it do daily mend, there is hopes of ſolution, though it may be ſomething long firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A thin ſediment in the beginning of a diſeaſe, which in the progreſs of the malady thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens daily by degrees, is good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews that nature endeavoured a concoction at the beginning, and doth daily labour to bring its work to perfection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A thick ſediment appearing in any time of the diſeaſe is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe ſediments are cauſed by thick and crude humors, which being mixed with the urine, ſeparate themſelves from the water, and by reaſon of the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſink down to the bottome of the chamberpot. Now becauſe thoſe thick and crude humors are very hard to be overcome by nature, therefore they do threaten much danger, eſpecially if the ſtrength of the body be decayed; but if there be any ſtrength of nature, they do onely ſignifie a prolongation of the diſeaſe: theſe crude and thick humors ſetling at the bottome of the chamberpot may deceive a young Phyſician, who may perhaps think them to be a good and true ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore they are to be exactly diſtinguiſhed from them. And <hi>firſt,</hi> thoſe crude and thick humors uſually appear at the beginning of a diſeaſe, but the good and true ſettlement never till the declination thereof. And it happens that after the beginning of the diſeaſe that thin and crude humor being attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there appears no more ſettlement in the bottome, but onely in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:153522:112"/>a cloud or matter hanging in the middle thereof, which as the concoction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, falls down daily from the upper part of the chamberpot to the lower parts; which is the true ſign of concoction when the cloud changes into that matter which hangs in the middle of the pot, and is called <hi>Enaeorema;</hi> and the <hi>Enaeorema</hi> into the fediment: but on the other ſide, when the ſettlement changes into the <hi>Enaeorema</hi> or <hi>cloud,</hi> that ſediment was not laudable, but a crude and thick humor which was afterwards attenuated by concoction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this crude humor doth not ſtick cloſe together, neither is it altogether ſmooth and equal, but ſlimie and over thick. But the laudable ſediment is ſmooth, equal, and moderately thick. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is heavier, and reſides altogether to the bottom of the chamberpot; but a good ſediment doth not cloſe but rather reſt on the bottom, being a little raiſed from it, and as it were gathered into a kind of globe, which the crude humor doth not do, but remains a little more diffuſed and ſcattered. When any one ſeems rid of a diſeaſe, yet makes diſcoloured waters, with a ſediment very white like ſnow, he dyes of a relapſe, as Dr. <hi>Pachecus</hi> obſerves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Black or blew ſediments in urine are worſt of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that for the reaſons which were told before where we treated of black urine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſhattered, unequal and black matter hanging in the middle, is bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſediment endued with theſe qualities hath been ſhewed before to be evil; all other things contained in the urine are bad for the ſame reaſons, though leſs evil then a ſediment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A little cloud at the top of the urine appearing in the form of a circle is evil in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies an approching <hi>Phrenſie,</hi> and after that death.</p>

                        <hi>Oily urines, wherein do ſwim little fat things like cobwebs, are evil.</hi> Hipp. 2. progn.</p>
                     <p>For it ſhews a mighty heat that melts the fat which is in the reins and the whole body. Now how you may know whether this colliquation proceed from thereins or from the whole body, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches <hi>Aph.</hi> 35. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. in theſe words; <hi>Thoſe who have a cloſe fat ſwimming on the top of their urine, have an acute evil in their veins.</hi> By an <hi>acute evil</hi> he means a hot diſtemper, which cauſes as it were little heaps of fat in the water; for there is a great quantity of fat heaped up about the reins, and from thence there is a ſhort and quick way for the coming forth of the urine, ſo that that which is melted ſticks not much by the way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the fat come forth in lumps, it proceeds from an acute evil in the veins; but if not in lumps, but like cobwebs, it ſhews a conſumption of the fat through the whole body. Of this oily urine there is an example in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 1 <hi>Epid. Aegr</hi> 11. in the wife of <hi>Dromeada,</hi> from whom on the fourth day there came thin and oily urine, on the fifth day the ſame, but the ſixth day ſhe dyed. Alſo in 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 1. in the ſon of <hi>Parion,</hi> who the ſeventh day voided oily water; and on the hundred and twentieth day dyed: and doubtleſs thoſe urines perſevered a good while, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſeems to intimate in theſe words; <hi>Urines continuing to the end are evil.</hi> So <hi>Aegr.</hi> 16. <hi>of the ſame ſect.</hi> A young man of <hi>Moelibea</hi> from the beginning of his diſeaſe made oily water, the twentyfourth day he dyed: now although theſe oily urines are extremely bad, yet the <hi>floury, ſlaty,</hi> and <hi>branny</hi> urines are much worſe, as we have ſhewed above.</p>

                     <p>This is hence diſcerned; for if the urine be full of evil contents, and yet be well concocted, it ſhews that the evil proceeds onely from ſome particular affection of the reins or bladder; for were it the product of a burning Feaver the urine would not be well concocted.

But to this he anſwers, that this day was either omitted by <hi>Hipp.</hi> himſelf, or by the man that firſt tranſcribed the book. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if Hipp. did altogether paſs it by, my opinion is, that he did it for this cauſe, becauſe that very many acute diſeaſes which are judged by ſweating receive a better judgment the third and fifth then upon the fourth day; for they are rare that are judged upon the fourth day: and this I have found by experience, who have made diligent ſearch why</hi> Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates

The <hi>third</hi> condition is, that good ſweats do follow ſome critical coldneſs. For when nature expelleth out of the urines the thin and acute humors, and thruſt them forth into the outſide of the body, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts by which thoſe humors paſs being by them bitten, ſhe cauſeth a trembling, with refrigeration of the extreme parts: but if nature be ſtrong enough, the heat breaking forth, an acute and great Feaver follows this trembling and refrigeration, by the heat of which the humors being attenuated, they are reſolved into a copious ſweat.

For then they ſpeak the faculty ſtrong that diffuſes warmth over the whole body, and digeſts the ſuperfluous humors into ſweat, reſolving them through all parts equally; which when it is much weakened, or affected with a malignant diſeaſe, it attempts without ſucceſs: for ſweats are unequally evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they come forth more in one place and leſs in another, or ſometimes not at all: many examples of this kind of ſweat <hi>Hipp.</hi> declares <hi>in Epid.</hi> as in <hi>Pericles,</hi> of whom he ſaith ſweat, <hi>The fourth day; brake forth over the whole body warm and in good quantity, without a Feaver, he was judged,</hi> and it never returned.

The <hi>ſixth and laſt</hi> condition is, that by that ſweat the diſeaſe ſhould be taken away, or at leaſt ſhould be diminiſhed. Therefore <hi>Hipp. in Epid.</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the beſt ſorts of ſweat, that do wholly take away the diſeaſe, often repeats, <hi>free from Feaver, or the Feaver ceaſed;</hi> or <hi>the Criſis was made without the Feaver.</hi> As to thoſe in whom the diſeaſe was onely diminiſhed, he relates the ſtory of one that lay ſick in the garden of <hi>Dealces,</hi> of whom he ſaith; <hi>The ſeventeenth day his extreme parts were cold, he was covered, had an acute Feaver, his whole body ſweat, he was eaſed, came better to his ſenſes yet the Feaver departed not; the twentieth day he ſlept, he came abſolutely to his ſenſes, he ſweat, the Feaver leſt him, and his thirſt alſo which returned again.

                     </p>
                     <p>The quantity. For it ſhews a multitude of humors which nature is hardly able to overcome, and that not to be done but in a long time, which cannot be granted in acute diſeaſes.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:153522:115"/>diſeaſe is raw, and therefore they ſhew a prolongation thereof at leaſt, or pains and relapſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Continual ſweatings, whether they be moderate, or in great meaſure in an acute diſeaſe, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie a weakneſs of nature, which cannot retain the humors until they can be prepared by concoction for an expulſion. And therefore they who continually ſweat, though it be moderately, if they eſpape, yet are they long ſick. But they that ſweat very much and often, tis certain they cannot hold out long. To this may be added, that whatſoever ſweats remain for many dayes, are ſymptomatical; for thoſe that are critical are at an end in the ſpace of one day.</p>

                        <hi>Every little ſweat, but eſpecially that which appears about the head and neck, is evil.</hi>

                     <p>For little ſweat, or dewineſs alwaies happenſs through a very great weakneſs, ſo that the ſtrength of nature is not able to contain the humors that are about the skin; as you may perceive in a ſwouning fit, where a ſmall dewy ſweat moiſtens the head, neck, and breaſt; as alſo ſuch a kind of ſweat appears often in dying people, which is vulgarly called <hi>diaphoretick.</hi> So in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 1. <hi>Silenus</hi> ſweat a little about the head, and the eleventh day dyed: ſo in the 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. a woman which after abortion was taken with a great Feaver, ſweat on the fourth day a little cold ſweat about the head, and the ſeventh day ſhe dyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweating that as ſoon as it breaks forth ſtopps again, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews that nature endeavours to expel the humor, but is not able to perform its work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Little ſweating, and an often coming and going of cold, is deadly.</hi> 1. Coac. Aph. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that this ſmall ſweating with frequent chilneſs ſignifies an Empyema; And certainly the humors contained in the veſſels cannot produce theſe effects; when as theſe kind of ſweats appear onely in the head and breaſt, but rather an Empyema being generated, the parts of the breaſt are moved by the acrimony of the purulency, whence proceeds that light cold, which is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſmall ſweat, through the weakneſs of the natural faculty, by which the nouriſhing juyce of the body is deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cold ſweats with an acute Feaver ſignifie death; with a milder diſeaſe a prolongation thereof.</hi> Aph. 37. Sect. 4.</p>
                     <p>In putrid feavers, the humors putrifie, ſometimes in the veſſels onely, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the whole body; whereby noxious humors are contained both in the ſubſtance of the parts, in the skin, and alſo in the whole habit of the body: both which happening together, that both the humors do putrifie in the veſſels, and that the natural heat is extinguiſhed, or near to an extinction, then the evacuations of theſe parts are ſenſibly cold. But nothing hinders but that the heat which is cauſed by putrefaction in the veſſels, may be violent to extremity, and therefore it is a deadly ſymptome, ſhewing that there are a multitude of humors abounding in the body of that perſon, that are ſo cold that they can neither be warmed by the natural heat, nor by the heat of the Feaver. Therefore if there happen cold ſweats in an acute Feaver, they foretell death; ſeeing that the multitude of cold &amp; crude humors cannot in ſo little a time be concocted, the natural heat being very weak. But if they happen in a more gentle Feaver, they do not foretell death, but a prolongation of the diſeaſe, becauſe the ſtrength is not ſo much weakened by a mild Feaver, and in it time is protracted, ſo that nature may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct that multitude of humors: this is the doctrine of <hi>Galen in comm. on this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſine.</hi> Notwithſtanding cold ſweats proceed from an extraordinary inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a ſimple diſſolution of the natural heat; For when there is any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:153522:115"/>inflammation in any of the internal parts, all the heat of the external parts is drawn inward, ſo that the outward parts remain altogether cold. And ſo it comes to paſs, that when that internal heat cauſes a great evapouration, thoſe vapours are condenſed upon the skin, and are turned into ſweat, and that a cold one alſo; being cooled by the coldneſs of the skin, as is wont to happen in the Feaver called lipyria. Alſo in dying people the natural heat being very much waſted, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through the ſmal quantity thereof to retire and collect it ſelf about the heart and interiour parts, whence all the external parts are left cold. But this heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up, cauſes ſtill ſome evapouration which congeals all into ſweat, and that likewiſe cold, by reaſon of the mentioned coldneſs of the external parts: but which of theſe two wayes ſoever theſe kind of ſweats do happen, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion mortal. Many examples of cold ſweat are declared by <hi>Hipp. in Epid.</hi> which clearly demonſtrate the truth of this prognoſtick; <hi>viz. in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr. Philiſcus</hi> the fifth day ſweat cold, the ſixth day died: and <hi>Aegr.</hi> 2. <hi>of the ſame Sect. Silenus</hi> the eighth day had a cold ſweat over his whole body, and the eleventh day died. Alſo 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. a woman which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an abortion was taken with a violent Feaver, the fourth day had a little cold ſweat about her head, and died the ſeventh day: and <hi>Aegr.</hi> 12. <hi>of the ſame Sect.</hi> A woman that had a cold ſweat over her whole body the ſeventh day, died the fourteenth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stinking ſweats in an acute diſeaſe are moſt dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſhew an extraordinary putrefaction of the humors, which deſtroys the natural conſtitution of the body.</p>
                     <p>The manner of excretion. <hi>If between the intervals of ſweating a coldneſs or ſhaking do often come and go, it is very bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that new endeavour of nature ſhews a great diſturbance thereof, which is not able conveniently to perfect its intended evacuation, but ſtill endeavours afreſh to the great danger both of ſtrength and life; whence <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>a ſhaking after ſweat is not good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweat that comes not kindly forth, but appears in the skin like graines of milet, is an evil ſigne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of ſweat uſes onely to appear in the neck and head by ſwounings, or other weakenings of the ſtrength, which cannot ſend forth ſweat copiouſly but in a little quantity onely, which is formed into little balls like graines of milet.</p>
                     <p>The time. <hi>Sweat that happens not upon the Critical day is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they are ſymptomatical, and cauſed by the force of the diſeaſe; for thoſe ſweats that are made by the motion of nature working in due order happen onely upon the critical dayes. So in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 11. the wife of <hi>Dromeada</hi> ſweat all over the ſixth day, and dyed the ſame day. And 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 3. <hi>Pythion</hi> ſweat much the tenth day, and dyed the ſame day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweats appearing in the beginning of a diſeaſe are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe in the beginning all things are crude, and nothing can be healthfully voided, unleſs it be firſt well concocted. And therefore this is a general rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all ſorts of evacuations, which can never be healthy in the beginning of a diſeaſe; ſo <hi>Philiſcus</hi> ſweat the firſt day, the third day about evening came an acute Feaver with ſweat; the fixth day he dyed: ſo the wife of <hi>Dremeada</hi> ſweat all over the third day, and dyed the ſixth. And that phrenetick perſon whoſe hiſtory is related <hi>in the third Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 4. The firſt day he ſweat much all over, and ſecond day he ſweat, and the fourth day dyed. By way of ulcer. <hi>Whatever abſceſſions appear after ſignes of concoction, and directly from the affected parts, and in a place remote from it, ſteep, and capacious, and not exquiſitely ſenſible, and which come
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:153522:116"/>quickly to a ſuppuration, are healthful; thoſe which happen contrary, are dangerous.</hi> The places moſt fit to receive abſceſſions are the thighs, legs, arms, groins, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, and joynts; for they are remote from the internal parts, or at leaſt fit to receive their excrements, and capacious enough, and endued with natural heat, ſo that the matter contained in them may eaſily be concocted, but if they are in the region of the belly they are dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What ever abſceſſions come forth when they are ſmall and come far out, jutting forth from the external parts, riſing up to a ſharp head, are good; but whatever ulcers are big, plain, and without a ſharp head, are evil; as alſo thoſe that turn inward, as likewiſe thoſe that break within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe are beſt that communicate nothing to the internal parts, but thruſt themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward much, cauſing little pain, and not changing the colour of the skin.</hi> Hipp. 2. progn. chap. 12.</p>
                     <p>The good or evil quality of abſceſſions is diſcerned by a threefold difference, that is, of the place where they break forth, of the figure which they retain, and the place into which they break. As to the <hi>firſt;</hi> By how much the more an abſceſſion tends to the external parts, by ſo much the better it is as a ſymptome, becauſe it ſhews the ſtrength of the expulſive faculty; and as a cauſe, for that it leſs offends the interiour parts. As to the <hi>figure, thoſe which are ſmall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hippocrates, are beſt</hi> (which is not to be underſtood ſimply of the quantity of the whole abſceſſion, the bigneſs whereof ought to anſwer the quantity of the matter, but of the largeneſs at the bottome, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe which have leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference at the bottome are beſt) then alſo thoſe which come out fartheſt, and riſe to a ſharp head; for they ſignifie a ſtrength of the expulſive faculty: but thoſe that are large at the bottom and leſs ſharp, for contrary reaſons are very bad. As to the <hi>breaking</hi> of them, thoſe are the beſt of all that break outward, for ſo the abſceſſion is more fit to be cured, and it is more commodious for the matter to break outward then to fall down upon the internal members. Laſtly, thoſe are the beſt that communicate no pain, inflammation, or other evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the internal parts, being in themſelves alſo not much painful, and cauſing little change in the natural colour of the skin, becauſe they ſhew that the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ulcer are in good temper, ſo that they help forward the cure thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Every abſceſſion which comes to ſuppuration, if it ſend forth commendable matter is a ſigne of health, if not, dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath been ſaid before, that the beſt ſort of matter ought to be white, ſmooth, and equal, and not ſtinking, and that which hath contrary qualities is evil, for it ſhews rather a putrefaction of the matter then a true concoction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the patient be not eaſed by the appearance of an ulcer in any part, but that the ſame ſymptomes remain, it is mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews that the ulcer proceeds rather from a ſettling of the matter in that part, then a critical expulſion, which alwaies gives eaſe to the ſick perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An ulcer appearing at the beginning of a diſeaſe, is worſt of all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For no evacuation can be profitable while the diſeaſe is crude; but in abſceſſions this muſt be peculiarly obſerved, that thoſe diſeaſes are for the moſt part mortal and peſtilent at the beginning whereof they do happen, whence they do preſage very great danger of life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ulcers appearing greater or leſs then they ought to be are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe that are leſs can not receive a ſufficient portion of the putrid matter, by which the diſeaſe may be either diſſolved or diminiſhed, and are therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. The greater denote too great a quantity of the matter cauſing the diſeaſe, ſo that it is to be feared that nature may ſink under her burden; as alſo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:153522:116"/>leſt beſides the skin and the muſcles, ſome inward or principal or neceſſary part ſhould be overcharged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe ulcers that after they have appeared retire back again, are deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſhew that nature is in a languiſhing condition endeavouring an evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but not able to perform its work, through an extraordinary weakneſs. Onely this muſt be underſtood, that this retirement muſt not be cauſed by any other evacuation provided by art or nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe which riſe to the ears with pain, are peſtiferous.</hi> 2. Coac. cha. 4.</p>
                     <p>For all thoſe kind of ulcers called <hi>Parotides,</hi> by the beſt of Phyſicians have alwaies been ſuſpected, by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the place, which is not capacious enough to receive all the matter; as alſo by reaſon of the nearneſs of the brain, to which there may be a reflux of the morbifical matter. But if theſe ulcers are very painful they are the more dangerous, for they fignifie a multitude of humors that extend the part, and ſo cauſe the pain. But if a flux of the belly follow the eruption of theſe ulcers, or that urine be copious, the patient often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers; as happened to <hi>Clazomenius in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>aegr.</hi> 10. who had a ſwelling with pain near both his ears on the ſeventeenth day: on the twenty ſeventh day thoſe ſwellings increaſed more, yet neither ſtayed, nor broke: on the thirty firſt day a flux of the belly took him, voiding much watry, dyſenterical matter; he made thick water, the ſwellings about his ears fell, and on the two and fourtieth day he recovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ulcers on the ears appearing with crude urine, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſhew that nature is not able to ſuppurate the morbifical matter, and to diſperſe it to convenient evacuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ulcers near the ears that happen when the ſtrength is decayed, are deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For then hath nature chiefly want of ſtrength to expel the morbifical matter, and to ſoften the ſuppuration of the ulcers, ſo that if they cannot anſwer nature in this, there is no hope of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe ulcers near the ears which come not to ſuppuration are evil, unleſs they are followed by a copious bleeding at the noſe, or a great flux, or that the patient voyd thick and concocted urine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet every flux doth not diſſipate theſe kind of ulcers, for in a peſtilent Feaver being accompanied with theſe <hi>Parotides,</hi> it doth many times kill the patient; but it is neceſſary that the flux of the belly be critical and laudable, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from the above mentioned ſignes concerning looſneſs. Hence <hi>Hipp. in Coac. If the hypochondrium be long afflicted, and the excrement of the belly of a bad ſmell, then ulcers near the ears are mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ulcers near the ears of a moderate bigneſs, without pain, the ſtrength of nature being not waſted, breaking out upon a critical day, the ſignes of concoction preceding, are good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though theſe ulcers near the ears are for the moſt part much ſuſpected, as is ſaid before, yet ſometimes they break out with much advantage, that is, if they appear with the above mentioned properties, for they ſhew that nature hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the cauſe of the diſeaſe. So in <hi>Clazomenius,</hi> of whom we have before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, his urines through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe were thin but well coloured and on the ſeventeenth day, which is critical, there appeared ulcers near his ears.</p>
                     <p>By bliſters] <hi>Bliſters appearing at the beginning of acute diſeaſes over the whole body, or ſome parts thereof, are dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe bliſters uſe to appear for the moſt part in malignant and peſtilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, being the ſymptomes of them, and threaten great danger, but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:153522:117"/>if they break out at the beginning of a diſeaſe: for it ſhews a more vehement malignity that ſtirs up nature before any concoction, to the expulſion of ſharp and venomous matter, which is the cauſe of theſe pimples. Whence <hi>Hipp. in Coac. In thoſe perſons upon whoſe bodies wheals do break out in Feavers all over, it is a deadly ſigne unleſs a purulent ulcer ſucceed them:</hi> and in another place, <hi>thoſe who have red and round pimples about their joynts upon the skin, and a chilneſs beſides, in ſuch perſons redneſs and blackneſs ariſes about the belly and groins, and they die;</hi> which <hi>Hipp.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Epid.</hi> by the example of <hi>Silenus,</hi> upon whoſe skin on the eighth day there aroſe little, red, round pimples like pox, and the eleventh day he died. And although thoſe pox and pimples which break out in children ſeem to be of this nature, yet they break out much to the health of the party affected, if it be cauſed by a ſimple ebullition and motion of nature, ſeparating the pure from the impure. But when they proceed from a contagious diſtemper in the air, then are they very dangerous, making many times great ſlaughters among children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pimples that are very red, or chiefly black; or blew, are pernicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being very red they ſignifie an intenſe heat in the humor, as appeared in <hi>Silenus;</hi> being black or blew they ſignifie an aduſtion of the humor, and a very great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, ſo that ſometimes they obtain the nature of carbuncles. So in the ſmal pox and meaſils, where ever black or blew pimples appear, the party affected dyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt</hi> qualities of the body. <hi>That heat in Feavers is beſt which is temperate, gentle, equal in all parts, with ſome moiſture, and moſt like the natural heat, with an equal ſoftneſs of the whole body. Firſt,</hi> That benign heat is diſtinguiſhed from the fiery heat by the moiſture that accompanies it, for the other is uſually dry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the equal ſoftneſs of the whole body it is diſtinguiſhed from the heat that uſes to be in malignant Feavers, which moſt commonly deceives the Phyſicians: for it is mild and gentle, moſt like the natural heat, the more intenſe heat being ſhut in, and not liberally diffuſed abroad. Wherefore to this good heat of the body there ought to be an equal ſoftneſs joyned, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches 2. <hi>prog. it is beſt for the whole body to be equally hot and ſoft:</hi> for an equal ſoftneſs of the body diſtinguiſhes the good heat from the others that are bad: and ſo the mild and gentle heat which is found in a malignant Feaver may eaſily be diſcerned by the unequal ſoftneſs of the body, the hypochondriacal parts being commonly hard and extended. Or at leaſt that heat will not be equal through the whole body when as the extreme parts will be found leſs warm, and above the belly a more intenſe heat. Thus a temperate heat equally diffuſed through the whole body, with an equal ſoftneſs, is alwaies a good ſigne; for it cannot be that a body endued with that heat and ſoftneſs can be dangerouſly ill; for that doth certainly demonſtrate that the bowels are without inflammation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, or notable putrefaction.</p>

                     <p>For that refrigeration of the extreme parts is cauſed in acute diſeaſes, either by reaſon of an internal inflammation, whoſe heat is ſo vehement, that it draws
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:153522:117"/>all the blood to it like a cupping-glaſs, ſo that the bowels of perſons ſo affected are burnt up, but the extreme parts are cold, becauſe of a defect of blood which is all retreated to the bowels, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> confirmes <hi>Aph.</hi> 48. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>In Feavers that intermit not, if the extreme parts be cold, and the internal parts be burnt up and dryed, it is mortal.</hi> But thoſe feavers wherein the extreme parts are hot and the inward parts cold, which are named Lipyriae, and are cauſed chiefly through an inflammation of the nervous parts, as the ventricle, gutts, and are alwaies mortal, and kill the patient in a few dayes. Otherwiſe this refrigeration of the extreme parts is cauſed through a diſſolution of the natural heat, the relickes of which are very little, bring chiefly collected in the heart and principal bowels, ſo that it cannot extend it ſelf to the exteriour parts; and therefore thoſe who are in that manner cold, are very weak, neither do they receive warmth again, but are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching to death; which <hi>Hipp.</hi> teſtifies <hi>in Prorrhet. As often as the patient finds himſelf cold after the cold fit of a Feaver, and does not again wax warm, he is in an evil condition.</hi> This is confirmed <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid.

                        <hi>Coldneſs of the tongue continuing ſome few dayes is mortal, as was obſerved in three ſick perſons, in whom no other extraordinary ſymptomes appeared, but a certain languiſhing of the ſtrength.</hi>

                     <p>For thereby is fignified an abundance of the morbifick cauſe, and the malignant quality thereof, againſt which nature enters the liſts in vain, whence follows a diſſolution of the natural heat, and at length death it ſelf.

Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Pythion</hi> the ſecond day had a refrigeration of the extreme parts, after ſome time they waxed warm again, on the third day they grew a little cold again, the fourth day they grew cold, and after that warm again. on the eighth day he had a coldneſs in the morning, at evening he waxed warm again: on the tenth he was very cold, had an acute Feaver, much ſweat, and dyed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> Hardneſs. <hi>The skin of the face and other parts being hard, rough and ſqual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, ſhew evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in acute diſeaſes it denotes a great drineſs cauſed by the heat of the Feaver;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:153522:118"/>but in diuturnal Feavers it ſhews a great conſumption of the natural moiſture, as in Hecticks. So 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>aegr.</hi> 15. in the wife of <hi>Dealces,</hi> on the ſeventeenth day ſhe had a dry ſtretching of the skin, and the one and twentieth day, dyed.

                     <p>
                        <hi>An extraordinary ſoftnes of skin in any diſeaſe is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in acute diſeaſes it ſignifies an extraordinary putrefaction which cauſes the parts of the body to flag, as appears in corps killed with a peſtilent feaver. In chronical diſeaſes it ſhews an abundance of flegme diſperſed over the whole body, as happens in a leucophlegmatia or dropſie ariſing from white flegme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An intenſe redneſs of the face with ſadneſs is evil.</hi> 2. Prorrh.</p>
                     <p>The colour, redneſs of the face, ſimply conſidered is not evil, for it ſhews ſometimes the near approching of the Criſis by a flux of blood; as <hi>Galen</hi> by this ſigne foretold of a Roman youth in preſence of other Phyſicians. But then the ſignes alſo of concoction ought to appear; but if while the diſeaſe is raw, the face appear very red, there is much fear of an inflammation, and eſpecially of the head and brain; for by this ſigne it is apparent that the blood is carried up into the head, and there inflames it; which cauſes ſadneſs to precede the phrenſie, becauſe that blood being burnt up by exceſſive heat turns to the nature of choler, as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth in <hi>his comm.</hi> in theſe words; <hi>When therefore the colour of the face appears freſh, and the patient is very ſad, there ſeems to be a certain hot affection in the brain, which burns up the blood, and for that cauſe, as is demonſtrated, begets black choler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Intenſe and as it were eryſipelatous redneſs appearing in the head and feet in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, with good ſignes are good, with evil, bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If they appear with good ſignes, they ſhew that nature is very ſtrong, and able to expel the noxious humors to the ignoble parts, whence that is to be eſteemed a laudable change which the eaſe of the patient neceſſarily followeth but; if they appear with evil ſignes, and the ſick perſon be no whit alleviated it is to be thought that the humors are ſtirred up by acceſs of new forces, <hi>viz.</hi> by a multiplication of that phlegmonous quality which oppreſſes the entralls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An extraordinary paleneſs, chiefly in the face, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews either a violent withdrawing of the heat to the inner parts, or an extinction thereof, or want of blood; which is the reaſon that that colour appears in the carcaſſes of deceaſed perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A blackneſs and blewneſs of the whole body, face, or extreme parts, is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it is cauſed through an extinction of the heat in thoſe parts, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. 2 <hi>prog. if the body be in ſuch a condition that the nails and fingers are blew, death is preſently to be expected.</hi> But that blewneſs is alwaies accompanyed with a coldneſs of the extreme parts, as you may ſee in the examples of <hi>Philiſcus, Silenus,</hi> and others, for the coldneſs of the extreme parts above recited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Black and blew fleſh on a bone diſeaſed is bad.</hi> Hipp. Aph. 2. Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>By a <hi>diſeaſed bone</hi> Hippocrates means that which is affected with a wound, ulcer, or rotenneſs. Now the fleſh grows black and blew in wounds or ulcers, either through the extinction of the heat, ſome gangrene or ſyderation, by reaſon of the greatneſs of inflammation, or through ſome bruiſe. And therefore when the fleſh of a corrupt or violated bone looks black and blew not cauſed by any bruiſe or ſyderation, it is a certain ſigne of putrefaction, which extinguiſhes the natural heat; and therefore that bone is to be cut off, or otherwiſe taken away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To change colour often in acute diſeaſes is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſay that bodyes do then <hi>change their colour</hi> when from their proper native
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:153522:118"/>colour, they turn to pale, white, or yellow, ruſty, green, leaden or black. But this often changing of colour ſhews that nature is very much oppreſſed, and that there is a great redundancy of evil humors.</p>
                     <p>If the jaundiſe happen to the patient in a Feaver before the ſeventh day, it is evil; but if on the ſeventh, <hi>or ninth, or eleventh, or fourteenth, it is good, unleſs the right hypochondrium grow hard.</hi> Aph. 62. and 64. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> are not ſo ſuperficially to be underſtood, when as many have been known to be ſick of the jaundiſe before the ſeventh day, and yet have recovered. It is therefore to be underſtood that by <hi>before the ſeventh day</hi> is meant, before the concoction of the matter cauſing the diſeaſe, which if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by the yellow jaundiſe, is evil, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſaith, becauſe ſuch a motion is ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomatical; but if the matter cauſing the diſeaſe be concocted and vanquiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh day, nature then driving it to the skin, which begets the jaundiſe, it betokens the health of the patient; which <hi>Hipp.</hi> confirms in his <hi>fourth book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diet of ſick perſons. In a cholerick feaver,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the jaundiſe coming with a coldneſs before the ſeventh day, diſſolves the diſeaſe; but if it come unſeaſonably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that cold, it is mortal.</hi> Yet we muſt know that <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſpoke therefore of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as being the firſt prefixed time of a good and wholeſome jaundiſe; becauſe it ſeldome comes to paſs, that the matter of cholerick feavers is concocted before the ſeventh day, at what time nature expels it to the skin, and cauſes the jaundiſe: whence it appears that the choler is thicker then to be voided by ſweat. Therefore <hi>Hipp. in this Aph.</hi> ſpeaks of that as moſt often happens, though it may ſometimes otherwiſe come to paſs. But a jaundiſe which comes in the ſeventh, ninth, eleventh, or fourteenth, being critical dayes, is good, becauſe it follows a good concoction, if there be no hardneſs in the right hypochondrium. For that hardneſs diſcovers an humor in the liver, which ſtreightens the veſſels that ſerve for the expurgation of the choler, or elſe obſtructs them, which cauſes an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cholerick humor into the habit of the body. But if there be no ſwelling in the liver, the jaundiſe is made by the expulſion of the choler cauſing the feaver into the habit of the body. To this ſigne theſe that follow are to be added, that in a critical jaundiſe, the urines be not ſo coloured as to die the linnen cloths that are dipt therein of a yellow colour, neither doth there appear any white dregs, as in a morbous jaundiſe; as alſo that thereby the feaver is quite diſſolved, or at leaſt much impaired.</p>
                     <p>The ſmell. <hi>A vehement ſtink exhaling from the body of the patient is evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies a great corruption of humors, which exhales and ſends forth ſtinking vapours from all parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When in acute diſeaſes the patient ſmells unwonted ſents, there being nothing that may give any ſuch ſent at hand, as the ſmell of fiſh, dirt, butter, or ſuch like; if there be alſo other evil ſymptoms, death is near, as Avicen teſtifies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Noiſe. <hi>A ratling or ſnorting in acute diſeaſes, which the patient doth make both ſleeping and waking as he draws breath, is mortal. Ratling or ſnorting breath is cauſed when the ſick perſon is ſenſible of a kind of ebullition, boyling, or noiſe in his throat like to that of ſnorting.</hi> This uſes to appear in all that die of an acute diſeaſe, for one or two daies before they depart, eſpecially in ſuch as die of a pleuriſie or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony; for it ſhews that the expulſive faculty is altogether extinguiſhed, that it is not able to drive the excrements from the windpipe, and the jaws. Therefore whatever ſick perſon in the increaſing of the diſeaſe is ſubject to ſuch a ſnorting, he is next neighbour to death. But ſometimes this ſnorting happens at
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:153522:119"/>the beginning of diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the pleuriſie, peripneumony, and rheumatick fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by reaſon of the deflux of humors to the windpipe and lungs: and then it is not neceſſarily mortal, becauſe in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, that humor may be expelled and diſſipated, as in thoſe that are troubled with <hi>Aſthmas,</hi> in whom this ſnorting is uſual without danger of life. And becauſe this ſnorting or ratling ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the beginning of the diſeaſes is ſometimes mortal, ſometimes not, it is to be underſtood, that that which is leaſt dangerous decreaſes as the diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and at length, ends for altogether, the humor being either expelled by cough, or diſſolved by the heat of the feaver: but that which is mortal continues obſtinately, and increaſes by little and little; which ſhews that nature is oppreſſed by the multitude of humors, and cannot expel them, but the patient muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where the meat deſcends into the ſtomach with a noiſe as if it were caſt into a well, it is an evil ſigne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews that the fibers of the Oeſophagus are reſolved that they cannot contain the deſcending nouriſhment, and as it were hand it to the ſtomach, as is done in the natural ſwallowing of the meat.</p>

                        <hi>A murmuring noiſe in the hypochondrium, breaking forth chiefly with dung, urine, and wind, diſſolves the pains and ſwellings in the hypochondriums, if they be new and without flegme.

                     <p>Tumours of the <hi>Hypochondriums</hi> which are often joyned with acute diſeaſes, if they be new and without a phlegmone (a phlegmone is diſcovered by the heat and beating of the part) then are they produced by wind. They ſhew ſome contumacy if they have a firm and fixt pain: but it is a very great ſigne of health, when the patient breaks and voids wind upward or downward, in belching, his ſtool, with or without dejection of excrement, and with his urine. When windcoms forth with urine it is known by the froth ſwimming at the top thereof; although the wind do not break forth, yet if it fall downward with a noiſe, it is a good ſigne, and indeed it is the beginning of health, becauſe the heat of the members begins to diſſipate the wind, and the members are not ſo extended but are conſtrained to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the wind, which is the firſt beginning of the victory.</p>
                     <p>Proper accidents. In the face. <hi>A cadaverous face is deadly, yet that leaſt which comes to be ſo through great watchings and looſneſs. And ſuch a kind of corruption ariſing for thoſe cauſes comes to an end in one day.</hi> 2. Coac. c. 5.</p>
                     <p>This face which <hi>Hipp. calls cadaverous,</hi> as it is like that which appears in dead carcaſſes and thoſe perſons who ly at the point of death, is vulgarly called <hi>Hippocrates face,</hi> becauſe it is ſo exactly and as it were with a pencil by him deſcribed 2 <hi>Coac. and</hi> 1 <hi>prog.</hi> in theſe words. <hi>His countenance was of this nature, his eyes hollow, his noſe ſharp, his temples fallen, his ears cold and contracted, the skin of his forehead hard, ſtretched, and dryed, the colour thereof pale or black, blew or leaden;</hi> all which things proceed from moſt pernicious cauſes: for the parts of the face are either truly lean, the ſubſtance thereof being conſumed; or elſe it hath a ſeeming leanneſs, cauſed by a withdrawing of the ſpirits and blood. For they give a lively and freſh colour to every part, and a moderate moiſture, which falls away when theſe are withdrawn; then alſo there is an external cold, that preſſes down the ſeveral parts, cauſing a greater extenuation. The heat which is moſt intenſe and malignant cauſes a conſumption of the fleſh. But the withdrawing the ſpirits and blood from the ſeveral parts is cauſed by the great weakneſs of the natural heat, that it cannot recruit it ſelf again;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:153522:119"/>or by reaſon of the great fire within, which draws the bloud and ſpirits to it like a cupping-glaſs. And therefore all thoſe great cauſes of extenuation which appear in the face, are very bad, and thoſe particles which <hi>Hipp.</hi> hath reckoned up are moſt capable of extenuation. For the eyes are very fat and full of ſpirits, which cauſes them to ſwell and hang out; if therefore that fat be conſumed, and the ſpirits be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, the eyes fall down, leaving the places which they did poſſeſs for the moſt part empty, which makes the eyes hollow. In the noſe the end or point onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thick, for the other parts are bones, griſtles, and skin without fleſh. In the tip thereof onely are certain thin and fleſhy fibers produced from the muſcles that move the cheeks; and therefore in that part of the noſe doth chiefly appear the extenuation cauſed by the diſeaſe; the hollowneſs of the temples are full of very moiſt muſcles, which is the cauſe that greyneſs begins uſually at the temples, which moiſture is quickly diminiſhed by the above mentioned cauſes. The cars are not without reaſon cooled though the weakneſs or retreat of the natural heat, both becauſe they are extreme parts &amp; remote from the fountain of heat, and alſo becauſe they are without fleſh, being onely compoſed of griſtle and skin; the tips of them alſo are contracted, and the skin of the forehead ſtretched drie and hard, by reaſon of the drought cauſed by conſumption of the moiſt <hi>parts;</hi> as skins which being dryed are contracted and ſhriveled up together. The pale colour, black or blew, proceeds from the withdrawing or exolution of natural heat and ſpirits, whence theſe refrigerated parts receive that colour. In the laſt place <hi>take notice,</hi> that this death reſembling face that ſhews it ſelf by the abovementioned ſignes, is moſt pernicious if it be produced by the internal cauſes before deſcribed; for if it pro ceed from procatarctical cauſes it is leſs dangerous, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> notes in this theorem, where he reckons only watching and looſneſs of the belly; but we may adde to that other procatarctical cauſes, as the effect of nouriſhment, ſadneſs, and fears. And it may be eaſily diſcerned whether it depend on theſe outward cauſes, for then the ſymptome laſts but one day, &amp; preſently the patient returns to his former ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In the eyes. <hi>You muſt well conſider how the eye is affected when the patient ſleeps; for if there do appear any thing white under the eyelids being half ſhut, if it proceed neither from phyſick, nor any looſneſs of the belly, tis an evil ſigne, and very mortal.</hi> Aph. 52. Sect. 6.</p>
                     <p>When the ſick perſon ſleeps with his eyes half ſhut, ſo that you may perceive underneath a certain whiteneſs, it ſhews a very great weakneſs of the animal faculty; for if the eyes, the cloſing of which is the eaſieſt work of the faculty, be ſhut in ſleeping, it ſign fies a very great impoveriſhment of the animal ſpirits. Therefore it is a deadly ſigne, if ſuch a reſolution be produced by the ſtrength of the diſeaſe; but if it proceed from any evacuation, either natural or procured by art, or any outward cauſe, by reaſon that that may be repaired again, this half ſhutting of the eyes is not ſo dangerous. <hi>Hipp.</hi> alſo adds another cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>prog.</hi> That is, if the ſick perſon were not wont to ſleep in that manner; for it is uſual with ſome to ſleep with their eyes half open. This ſymptome is of great uſe in acute diſeaſes of the head, whether with or without a feaver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eyes are next the brain, and as it were joyned to them, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently moſt certainly declare the affections thereof: but in other diſeaſes they denounce not danger ſo ſurely. For children that are troubled with the worms do frequently ſleep with their eyes open, and are eaſily recovered. This affection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not alwayes from an impairing of the ſtrength, but ſometimes from a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the muſcles moving the eyes, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches <hi>in his Comm. on this Aphoriſme.</hi>

                        <hi>If in an acute diſeaſe one eye groweth leſs then the other, tis mortal.</hi> Hipp. 1. progn.</p>
                     <p>For it is cauſed by a weakneſs of the faculty governing the eye, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to deſert its office; but it would be much worſe to ſee both the eyes extenuated, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the ſame faculty. But this extenuation begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:153522:120"/>in one of the eyes, for ſeldome it is that both eyes are in the ſame condition. For ſo a conſumption that is about to afflict the whole body uſes to begin to take its riſe from one or two members, and thence to creep to the reſt, and thence to the reſt, as they are more or leſs prone to receive it. Yet you <hi>muſt obſerve</hi> whether this extenuation proceed from any particular diſeaſe in the eye, and not from a weakneſs of the faculty, then it ſpeaks no danger at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If in acute diſeaſes the white of the eye appear red, tis evil.</hi> Hipp. 1. progn.</p>
                     <p>For it ſhews either blood or choler tranſlated to the brain, whence an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and phrenſie the product thereof is to be expected, which threaten much danger to life. For the tunicle that conſtitutes the white of the eye ariſing from the membranes of the brain, the inflammation of them is eaſily communicated to the tunicle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If in an acute diſeaſe the veines of the eyes appear black or blew, it is a mortal ſigne.</hi> 1. prog.</p>
                     <p>For either it ſignifies that aduſt and atrabilary humors abound in the brain, or elſe an extinction of the natural heat, which hath cauſed the blood to loſe its native colour, and to acquire concretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the eyes are perverted in an acute diſeaſe, it is evil.</hi> 1. prog.</p>
                     <p>The eyes are ſaid to be <hi>perverted</hi> when they move out of order and decorum, that is, either more upward then they ought, or more downward, or more to one ſide then the other; as alſo if one move upward and the other downward, or if one be drawn to one corner, and the other to the other. Which diſtortions of the eyes are cauſed by the convulſions of the muſcles that move the eyes, as comes to paſs in a fit of the epilepſie, though there they are not dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But convulſions happening in acute diſeaſes are very pernicious; eyes dark, muddy, galled, and not ſhining, are evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the cauſe of theſe evils comes from a defect and extinction of the animal ſpirits, which are clear, and cauſe a ſhining in the eyes; alſo from an extraordinary drineſs of the tunicles that compoſe the eye, but more eſpecially of the <hi>corneous</hi> tunicle, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches 1. <hi>of the cauſe of ſymptomes. and</hi> 10. <hi>of the uſe of the parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the eyebrows, noſtrils, and lipps. <hi>If the eyebrow be diſtorted, or black and blew, or pale, or the lipps or noſe, with any other bad ſymptomes, know, death is at hand. For tis a mortal ſigne when the lipps hang looſe, and are cold and white.</hi> Hipp. 1 prog.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſame opinion is <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 49. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. in theſe words. <hi>In a Feaver that intermitts not, if the lip or eyelid or eyebrow, or the noſe be diſtorted, and the ſick perſon do neither ſee nor hear, the body being already weak, death is near.</hi> For all this is cauſed by the convulſion of the muſcles moving theſe parts, which in acute diſeaſes are mortal, as hath been ſhewn. Now the eyebrows become pale, or black and blew, through an extinction of the natural moiſture. The hanging and looſneſs, coldneſs, whiteneſs of the lips do alſo ſhew a weakneſs of the moving faculty, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the natural heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The noſtrils dilated more then ordinary in an acute diſeaſe portend danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they ſignifie a great weakneſs of the animal faculty, which not being able to dilate the breaſt ſufficiently, to temper the extraordinary heat, endeavours to compenſate that defect by widening the noſtrils to let the air in more freely.</p>
                     <p>In the teeth. <hi>To make a noiſe and greate with the teeth in feavers where it hath not been a cuſtome from their youth, portends phrenſie and death.</hi> 2. prog.</p>
                     <p>This very rule <hi>Hipp.</hi> repeats <hi>in</hi> 2. <hi>prorrhet.</hi> in theſe words; <hi>to make a noiſe with the teeth is pernicious, where it was not uſed in time of health.</hi> But <hi>Galen in</hi> 2. <hi>prog. To make a noiſe with the teeth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>where it hath not been before a cuſtome, is a ſigne of future madneſs; but if the patient at the ſame time be mad, and make a noiſe with his teeth, believe him not to be far from death.</hi>

                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:153522:120"/>
                     <p>This noiſe of the teeth is cauſed by the convulſions of the muſcles moving the jaw bones, or a weakneſs of the moving faculty; which ſoever it is, in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes it ſignifies a great diſtemper of the brain, to which tis very likely that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſucceed, when as madneſs is nothing but a diſtemper of that faculty which is predominant in the brain, which increaſing, death muſt follow of neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But madneſs uſeth to ſucceed that noiſe of the teeth that makes a great ſound, ſooner then that which cauſes but alittle ſound. For that may be through a weakneſs that may bring death without madneſs: but the other is by convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which proceed from malignant vapours, ſuch as ariſe from black choler invading the brain and nervous parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe who in feavers have a ſlimineſs and blackneſs about their teeth are in danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſhews abundance of crude and thick humors, and a mighty heat of the feaver which dryes and burns up thoſe crude and thick humors.</p>
                     <p>In the tongue. <hi>A black tongue with drineſs, roughneſs, clefts, and burning, is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all theſe proceed from a very hot and burning feaver, through the force of which the tongue grows very dry, and receiving thoſe aduſt vapours that riſe from the heat of the bowels, it becomes like a chimney all ſooted with blackneſs. From aleſs heat proceeds drineſs and roughneſs, but from a more vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the clefts, as when the earth parched by the heat of ſummer, revolts into chinks and diviſions. The tongue burnt and ſcorched at firſt, ſhews an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome one of the bowels, which is perceived by the pain, hardneſs, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and heat of the <hi>Hypochondriums.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A trembling tongue in acute diſeaſes is mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it ſignifies aweakneſs of the animal faculty, and a high diſtemper of the brain, and therefore in mad people about to dy the tongue is ſeen to tremble in this manner. Which <hi>Galen</hi> makes very apparent <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Prorrhet. text.</hi> 19. in theſe words. <hi>Therefore a trembling in the tongue happens from a weakneſs in the animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty proceeding from a dry diſtemper. The drineſs of the muſcles thereof, joyntly affected with the head, ſucceeded by convulſions, as the voice trembles through the weakneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the imbecillity of theſe parts. But all theſe foreſaid ſymptomes which proceed from a more intenſe drineſs of the head, portend a diſturbance of the mind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the jaws. <hi>When the jaws are exulcerated with a Feaver, tis an evil ſigne; and if there happen any other of theſe ſymptomes which we have ſaid to be evil, then conclude the perſon is in danger.</hi> Hipp. 2. prog.</p>
                     <p>The jaws are wont to be exulcerated, either by a ſharp diſtillation flowing from the head, or when the whole body is full of ill humors, in a burning and peſtilent feaver; Whereby it happens to moſt of thoſe who ly ſick of the pox or leproſie, that their jaws are exulcerated. But in acute diſeaſes, of which we now onely diſcourſe, for the moſt part the ſeat of the evil is in the breaſt or <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driums.</hi> Now the jaws lying in the way that leads from the lungs and from the ſtomach, they receive all the vapours that aſcend from thoſe places, which if they be ſharp, they exulcerate them. And therefore in thoſe kind of feavers, theſe places ought to be obſerved as much as the tongue; for it ſhews the vehemency of the feaver in the ſame manner: for as in a burning Feaver the tongue becomes dry, &amp; divided into many clefts, if it be vehement; ſo likewiſe ulcers in the jaws are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed if the Phyſician in the heat of the Feaver be not the more diligent in the uſe of thoſe things that allay thirſt. Now if the Phyſician omit not thoſe helps, and the jaws become ulcerated, it is a ſign of more violent heat. And therefore well ſaid <hi>Hip.</hi> that it was evil, yet not ſo evil as to be a ſymptome of death without other ſignes For it may be that by reaſon of ſome diſtillation accompanying the Feaver, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:153522:121"/>the jaws may be exulcerated, which is not ſo evil, as that death may be preſaged from this onely ſigne: but if the exulceration of the jaws proceed from any great diſtemper of the inferior parts, it is very dangerous; but then alſo there muſt of neceſſity be many other evil ſignes joyned with it. And therefore you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the other ſignes, and if any of them be evil, you may then foretel death. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius</hi> gives a great commendation of this ſymptome; I, ſaith he, <hi>can teſtifie, that this ſigne is to be valued, and that I have ſeen many in whom the feaver hath ſeemed ſlack, yet have they dyed with this diſtemper. That which is worſt is when it brings a loathing, ſo that they can take nothing down, deteſting the very drink it ſelf, though they be almoſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched up: in this diſtemper I have conceived that all the internal parts from the throat to the very ſtomach have been exulcerated.</hi> Thus far <hi>Valeſius.</hi> But we have a thouſand times ſeen thoſe exulcerations and inflammations of the jaws in thoſe peſtilent feavers that were ſo popular ſome few years agoe, and infected chiefly the kings camp. They appeared for the moſt part at the beginning of the diſeaſe, ſo that they were vulgarly accounted the pathognomical ſymptome of that diſeaſe. Whence it is to be conjectured, that they are generated by an evil and malignant humor.</p>
                     <p>In the Hypochondriums. <hi>Thoſe Hypochondriums are beſt that are without pain, ſoft and equal, both on the right and left ſide.</hi> 1. prog.</p>
                     <p>By the Hypochondriums are meant all that region which is between the midrif and the navel, in which the liver, ſtomach, and ſpleen are contained. The handling of this part is not to be deſpiſed by the Phyſician in diſeaſes, for it makes much for prognoſtication. And indeed the Phyſician ſhould every day diligently feel the Hypochondriums, in imitation of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who was wont to uſe it much, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 8. where he ſaith, that <hi>Silenus</hi> the third day had a diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Hypochondriums, by which he intimates that he had felt it the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes. And therefore the Phyſicians ought to be very diligent daily to know the ſtate of the Hypochondriums, there being the ſeat of the natural faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> of the natural bowels, where all the power of life and death is ſeated, and in which as in a Theatre all the duels of nature and the diſeaſe are fought, which ought to be accurately obſerved by the Phyſician. Therefore in acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, for the Hypochondriums to be in a good condition, affords no contemptible hopes of a good event; for it is impoſſible that any of thoſe parts ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, and the Hypochondriums be ſoft and without pain. Then ought there to be an equality both on the right and left ſide, which equality ought to be in all the accidents, as heat, ſoftneſs, and bulk; for ſuch are the Hypochondriums that appear in healthy men.</p>

                        <hi>A burning Hypochondrium, or painful, or extended, or having the right parts unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with the left, is a ſigne of no gentle diſeaſe.</hi> Hipp. 2. Coac. and 1. prog.</p>
                     <p>A burning Hypochondrium, and abounding with much heat, is cauſed by the multitude of hot humors putrifying in that place. Pain and diſtenſion are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the ſame cauſes filling the parts, and producing an evil diſtemper in them; or elſe drineſs is introduced by the overmuch heat which cauſes the diſtenſion. They are ſaid to be unequally affected on either ſide, when they are here hotter, there colder, here harder, there ſofter, here ſmoother, there rougher, here more, there leſs diſtended, here painful, there without pain; all which things ſhew that ſome of thoſe parts and inflamed, and ill affected, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often in acute feavers.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It happens ſometimes that the Hypocnoudriums are drawn upwards by the flowing up of the humors, by the force of the liver contracting it ſelf, and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:153522:121"/>them off, which happens notwithſtanding without pain, and endures but a ſmall while, there being other ſignes of a future bleeding; But if this revulſion of the Hypochondriums ſtay long without any ſignes of future bleeding, it is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; for it is cauſed by an inflammation, or exſiccation proceeding from the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh heat of the midrif or the membrane that covers the ribs, which parts being contracted and ſhriveld up draw with it the peritoneum and the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, which are to knit to them. The certain ſymptome of this accident is a ſhrill voice, which before was big; for the change proceeds from the contraction of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> whence <hi>Hipp. in Coac. They who have a ſhrill voice have their Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driums drawn and ſhriveld upward.</hi>

                        <hi>A hard and painful ſwelling in the Hypochondrium is very bad, if it be all over the Hypochondrium; but if it be in one part, it is leſs dangerous, being in the left.</hi> Hipp. 1. prog.</p>
                     <p>A hard and painful ſwelling proceeding from an inflammation portends very great danger, if it poſſeſs the whole Hypochondrium; if the right ſide onely, leſs; if the left, leaſt of all: the reaſon of this is evident; fort is moſt pernicious to have all the bowels inflamed at once in an acute diſeaſe. Now the liver being placed in the right part; in the left, the ſpleen; tis moſt certain that this vehement affection is leſs dangerous in the ſpleen then in the liver, which is the more noble bowel.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the time when the diſeaſe will end, wherein the day and hour of the Criſis is foretold.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe time of the Criſis is known chiefly two wayes, by the acuteneſs of the diſeaſe, and the ſignes of concoction, which ſhall be made plain in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing theorems.</p>
                  <p>The difference of acute diſeaſes. <hi>Diſeaſes ſimply acute uſe to be judged upon the fourteenth day; peracute ones upon the ſeventh day; and thoſe that are moſt peracute on the fourth day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe differences of acute diſeaſes we ſhall know by the vehemence and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſymptomes: for if preſently on the firſt day the ſymptomes increaſe, gaining ſtrength and violence, the diſeaſe will be moſt or extremely peracute, and will be judged the fourth day. But if they gain ſtrength &amp; violence the firſt quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and not preſently on the firſt day, that will be a peracute diſeaſe, and will be judged the ſeventh day. But if the vehemence of the ſymptome appear upon the ſecond quaternary, and in the beginning of it, the Criſis will be expected the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day. If after the ſeventh day the violence begin to rage, judgement will be made on the twentieth or twenty one.</p>
                  <p>Here it is to be <hi>noted,</hi> that thoſe Criſes do not ſeldome prevent the days of judgement, or retard them, according to the fluidneſs or obſtinacy of the matter, and are perfected on judicatory dayes, which alſo are ſomewhat judicatory: and thus may theſe be known; when the vehemence of the diſeaſe either begins either a little too ſoon or too late; as for example, when the violence begins in the beginning of the ſecond quaternary, that is on the fifth day, the Criſis will be lookt for on the fourteenth. But if it begin on the ſixth or ſeventh, expect the Criſis upon the ſeventeenth day. But there is required in this a very diligent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe perfected by the uſe of art.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If ſignes of concoction appear in the firſt day of the diſeaſe, the diſeaſe will be judged the fourth day; if on the fourth, then the Criſis will come upon the ſeventh. If on the ſeventh, judgement will be made on the eleventh: If on the eleventh, the day of Criſis will be the fourteenth; and ſo of the other dayes, computing the quaternaries or ſeptena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the nature of the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſignes of concoctions are to be ſeen in another place; of which the chief in feavers is the ſediment of the urine. <hi>Note</hi> here that in obſerving the ſignes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction you muſt take along with you the vehemency of the ſymptomes, that you may thence make a certain prognoſtication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the approch of the Criſis is eaſily known from the perturbation that precedes it; for when the combate between nature and the diſeaſe begins, then the ſymptomes are chiefly exaſperated. Which</hi> Hipp. <hi>intimates</hi> Aph 13. Sect. 2. where the Criſis is made, the night before the acceſs of it is troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, the hour of the Criſis may hence be artificially preſaged; ſuppoſe that every Criſis is made in the height and vigour of the diſeaſe, when therefore we know when the diſeaſe is at the height, we may eaſily perceive the hour of the Criſis. Again, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe uſe to have any fits or exaſperations, we firſt note the hour of their coming, and the time of their ſtay, and at what hour the vigour and height of that fit prevails moſt; for it being certain that the Criſis comes in the heat and vigour of the diſeaſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperation thereof, thoſe being diligently found out, not onely the day, but the very hour of the approching Criſis may be foretold.</hi>

                  <p>EVery critical evacuation is made by vomit, by flux of the belly, by ſweat, by urine, bleeding, in moneths, hemorrhoids, or abſceſſions, the ſignes of which being fetched from the mentioned heads ſhall be declared in the following theorems; beginning with vomiting.</p>
                  <p>Actions and viſions. <hi>Dark apparitions preſented to the eyes foretel an approching vomit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they ſhew that the matter cauſing the diſeaſe is heaped up in the ſtomach, which ſends up vapours in great plenty to the head, that cauſes thoſe dark viſions.</p>

                     <hi>A ſharp and pricking pain in the head foretels vomiting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For that pain being excited by the foreſaid vapours, they with their acrimony bite the filmes of the brain.</p>

                     <hi>A trembling of the lower lip ſhews approching vomit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is cauſed by a ſympathy of the inner tunicle of the ſtomach with the mouth and palate.</p>

                  <p>THe Criſis which is made by looſneſs hath not very plain and manifeſt ſignes, yet may it be known partly by the ſignes which ſhall be ſet down, and partly alſo by the want of thoſe ſignes which uſually ſhew other Criſes.

                  </p>
                  <p>For when the noxious humor is carried through the meſaraical veins into the inteſtines, it communicates a pain to the loyns by the continuity of the meſenterium that draws its original from the ligaments that knit together the joynts of the loyns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe whoſe Hypochondriums being lifted up have a murmuring ſound with a pain in the loyns, will have a looſneſs, unleſs ſtatulencies break forth with a great quantity of urine: but this is onely in feavers.</hi> Aph. 73. Sect. 4.</p>
                  <p>When the region of the Hypochondriums ſwels and makes a noiſe, it is a ſigne that the humour and wind doth abound in that place: to which if a pain in the loyns ſucceed, that humour and wind creepeth downward; which cauſes a looſneſs, or at leaſt an cruption of wind from the ſeat, unleſs that humour be voided by urine.</p>

                  <p>From the obſervation of the ſeries of this table we ſhall propound theſe theorems following.</p>
                  <p>The eſſence. <hi>Moſt acute diſeaſes are judged moſt commonly by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For that proceeds from a cholerick humor, hot and thin, eaſily expelled through the habit of the body.</p>
                  <p>The efficient cauſes, the aire. <hi>In a hot and moiſt conſtitution of the aire diſeaſes are terminated moſt commonly by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For by a hot and moiſt temper of the aire the pores and paſſages of the body are looſened and opened, and the humors are renderd more fluid; ſo that they are more eaſily purged forth by ſweat.</p>
                  <p>The humors. <hi>Whatever diſeaſes are produced from a hot and thin humor, are judged by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So cholerick feavers are judged for the moſt part by ſweat, becauſe the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heat of the humor is more eaſily expelled by nature by that way of evacuation.</p>
                  <p>The material cauſe; the body of patient. <hi>Whoever in their ſickneſs have a ſoft and looſe skin, have their diſeaſes more eaſily judged by ſweating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Effects; the animal actions. Coldneſs. Whether that looſneſs and ſoftneſs of the skin proceed from the natural diſpoſition of the body, or the conſtitution of the aire, they avail much to perfect the Criſis by ſweating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A coldneſs or ſhaking in continual Feavers ſhew that the Criſis will be performed by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thoſe humors being thin when they are carried by the veins to the habit, with their ſharpneſs they bite the membranous parts of the body, and ſo cauſe a ſhaking.</p>
                  <p>Vital. Pulſe. <hi>Aſoft and fluctuating pulſe in feavers, foretels ſweat to be near at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when the more thin parts of the urine endeavour a paſſage through the body, they moiſten and ſoften the arteries, which cauſes a moiſt and fluctuating pulſe, which is the forerunner of ſweat.</p>
                  <p>Natural. <hi>Suppreſſion of urine. Suppreſſion of urine in feavers ſhews the Criſis near at hand by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when the matter of ſweat and urine are the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſerous humor, while they are carried to the habit of the body, it follows conſequently that the urine muſt be ſuppreſſed, or be much leſſened in quantity.</p>
                  <p>The excrements. <hi>If a hot vapour be perceived to ariſe from the body of the ſick pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or a ſlight kind of dew, it ſhews the approch of the Criſis by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If contrary to cuſtome, the external parts of the body of the ſick perſon grow hot, or the face grow red, it ſhews the Criſis is approching by ſweat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two laſt ſignes ſhew that nature endeavours a paſſage to the habit of the body, by which ſhe may expel the noxious and preternatural humors.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When the bloud begins to be carried up to the head, it begets phantaſms or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of red things, both by dreams, and in awaking: As happened to a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man youth of whom <hi>Galen</hi> makes mention. For he labouring with an acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, thought that he ſaw a red Serpent running about the roof of his chamber, which cauſed him ſuddenly to leap out of his bed; from whence <hi>Galen</hi> foretold bleeding, and forbid the letting bloud, which other Phyſicians had preſcribed. Pain in the head and neck proceeds from the ſame tranſlation of the bloud to the upper parts, which by griping and diſtending the membranes begets pain; the arteries beat through the extraordinary motion of the temples, being oppreſſed and ſtreightned by the fulneſs of the veins. Tingling of the ears is cauſed by the aſcending of the vapours in great plenty to the head. Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſight proceeds from certain thick and copious vapours which ariſing to the upper parts ſtop the paſſages, whence it comes to paſs that they ſhuting out the animal ſpirits, the ſight is dulled. That kind of lightning which hovereth before the eyes is nothing elſe but certain little thin and ragged bodies of ſeveral colours contained between the chryſtalline and carneous Tunicle, produced from the vapours carried upward, which though they are within, yet deceive the ſight as if they were without, when as the eye uſed to external objects, judges that to be without which is within. A redneſs of the face and eyes is cauſed by the bloud gathered in more abundance to thoſe parts. The averſion from light proceeds from this, that the eyes being already diſtended with plenty of humors, are more diſtended by the light; becauſe light ſcatters the ſpirits, which cauſes a dilatation of the eye, and thence pain, which that the ſick perſon may avoid, he ſhuns the light. Involuntary tears are cauſed by a repletion of the eyes and parts adjacent, which being diſtended beyond meaſure, preſs the kernels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the humors, which cauſeth tears. Itching of the noſe is cauſed by the aſcent of the vapours, which tickle the noſe. A drop of bloud appearing on a ſymptomatical day, as the fourth or ſeventh, ſhews that the bleeding will be on the day of the Criſis, that is on the ſeventh or fourteenth, becauſe nature begins to drive the humor to thoſe parts upon thoſe days. Difficulty of breathing is cauſed by the bloud, which when it is carried to the upper parts cauſes a compreſſion of the diaphragma. The tenſion of the hypochondriums is cauſed by reaſon that the bloud begins to ſtir in its fountain, and in the roots of the veins; but that diſtention continues not, and is without pain; ſo is difficulty of breathing: for ſhould they continue obſtinately and long, they would rather portend an inflammation of the Liver.</p>

                  <p>THe following aphoriſmes do briefly declare when an ulcer will break out in any diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as are detained with long Feavers, have long ſwellings, and pains do ariſe in their joynts.</hi> Aph. 44. Sect. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe feavers are ſaid to be long, which laſt above forty dayes; and are cauſed by a thick, cold and contumacious matter; and therefore becauſe that matter cannot eaſily be evacuated by excretory cauſe, nature often expels it to the weaker parts, and there begets an ulcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who void crude and thin urine for a long time, if other ſymptomes promiſe life, an abſceſſion is to be expected in the parts below the midrif.</hi> Hipp. 2. prog.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſaid before that the ſignes of crudity remaining for a long time, if the ſtrength be impaired, portend death, becauſe it is to be feared that the patient cannot hold out till the matter be concocted. But if the ſtrength of the body is in a good condition, and other ſignes do promiſe a recovery, it is to be hoped that the patient may be cured, not by a perfect ſolution, but by permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or abſceſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the urine ſtops with a coldneſs, in ſuch as are very ſleepy it is a hopeful ſigne of ulcers near the ears.</hi> Hipp. Coac.</p>
                  <p>For that ſleepineſs ſhews a great oppreſſion of the brain, at which time cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming on produces either an ulcer or a great convulſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who are ſick of a Feaver, having a wearineſs and faintneſs upon them, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an ulcer in their joynts, or about their jaws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:153522:125"/>
                  <p>For a voluntary faintneſs in feavers proceeds from an abundance of thick and crude humors, and thoſe feavers are moſt difficultly judged, and their judication is commonly by the breaking forth of an ulcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If on the patients recovery any part be diſtempered, tis a ſigne that ſome ulcer will break out there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not onely the pain which afflicts any part at the declining of the diſeaſe, but alſo all the ſymptomes that ſhew a weakneſs in the part, are ſignes of an ulcer thereabout.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of the ſignes of thoſe things which will happen to one already ſick, or falling into a diſeaſe; and firſt of the ſignes of approching madneſs.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MAny things uſually fall out in diſeaſes beſides the Criſis, as vehement ſymptomes, the changing of one diſeaſe into another; all which things if they can be foreſeen by the Phyſician, gain him a very honourable eſteem, and are of a ſpecial utility to the patient. Therefore we ſhall endeavour to lay down their ſymptomes, according to the foreſaid method, beginning from the ſignes of approching madneſs, which are known by theſe rules.</p>
                  <p>Animal actions. Principal. <hi>Forgetfulneſs preſently happening in acute diſeaſes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels a phrenſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews that the brain is affected, and that the matter cauſing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is hurried up thither from the lower parts.</p>
                  <p>Leſs principal. Sleep and waking. <hi>Troubled and tumultuous ſleeps foretel deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Hipp.</hi> taught <hi>in Coac.</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Turbulent and furious wakings out of ſleep bring madneſs.</hi> For they ſhew the brain to be very much affected, and unſetled from its natural condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Continual watching brings madneſs.</hi> Hipp. 2. prog.</p>
                  <p>For both of theſe affections are produced from the ſame cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> from a hot and dry diſtemper of the brain; as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches in 4 <hi>of preſage by pulſe.</hi> A more remiſs diſtemper cauſeth watchfulneſs, and a more intenſe one mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The hearing. <hi>A thingling and ſound in the ears, or deafneſs, often precedes madneſs, eſpecially if it appear with urine that hath matter lifted up and hanging in it.</hi> Hipp. 1. prorrhet.</p>
                  <p>For theſe things do ſhew that the noxious matter is carried up to the brain, which excites madneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſence of ſmelling too exquiſite denounces madneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews an unwonted drineſs of the brain, and an attenuation of the ſpirits, which diſpoſeth the brain to madneſs. Feeling vehement and continual pain of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:153522:126"/>head in acute feavers portends madneſs, eſpecially when it is obſerved moſt in the ears, or which is joyned with revulſions of the midrif; for it ſignifies that the humors are copiouſly carried up to the brain, and do vehemently diſtemper it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pain of the ſide, which with cholerick ſpittle vaniſheth away without any manifeſt cauſe, is a ſigne of madneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews a tranſlation of the cholerick humor from the ſide to the brain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pains in the leggs haſten madneſs, and that as well at other times, as eſpecially if there is a bad enaeorema in the urine.</hi> Hipp. in Coac.</p>
                  <p>There is ſo great a ſympathy of the legs with the principal parts, that as in a rupture of the heel, there do happen peracute trembling, ſobbing feavers which laſt but little, hot and mortal; ſo in the pain of the legs, which is cauſed by a malignant humor, there is a feaver ſtirred up in the heart, and madneſs in the brain, the peſtilent humors eaſily invading the brain. Now although theſe pains not onely of the legs but alſo of the thighs, back, and other ignoble parts do por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend madneſs, yet they performe it more certainly, if ſoon after appearance they withdraw again, for they ſignifie a tranſlation of the morbifick matter to the brain, as you may ſee in <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Aegr.</hi> 5. where <hi>Calvus</hi> on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den had a pain in his right thigh, and no remedies prevailed; The firſt day he had a burning and acute feaver, and the pain increaſed; the third day the pain ceaſed, and a madneſs with much tumbling and toſſing enſued: the fourth day about noon be dyed in a venement fit.</p>
                  <p>Vital affections. <hi>A vehement and unfrequent drawing of the breath ſhewes madneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A vehement and rare drawing of breath is proper to mad people. <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>prog.</hi> 24. For they having need of reſpiration by reaſon of the heat of the feaver, and forgetting to breath through the violence of the madneſs, it comes to paſs that they ſeldome breath, and the frequency thereof is made up by the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of breathing: this is the opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> in his book <hi>of the difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chap.</hi> 3. where he ſhews that a reſpiration of this ſort is proper to mad people: and <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>of the ſame book,</hi> he ſaith that <hi>Philiſcus</hi> and <hi>Silenus</hi> had no other cauſes of ſuch reſpiration but madneſs: of <hi>Philiſcus</hi> and <hi>Silenus</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Hipp.</hi> in <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 12. both of them at the firſt were troubled with a rare and vehement breathing, which was ſucceeded by a manifeſt madneſs in the progreſs of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Excrements. <hi>White and clear urines in acute diſeaſes are manifeſt ſignes of madneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they ſignifie that the choler that wont to be poured out with the urine, and to give a colour to it, is transferred to the brain.</p>
                  <p>Qualities changed. <hi>If in an acute diſeaſe the white of the eye appear red, it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a phreaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſignifies that the membranes of the brain are inflamed, which inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is eaſily communicated to the adnate tunicle, which proceeds from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proper accidents.</hi> If there be a pulſe in the Hypochondrium, it ſignifies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, or madneſs; but in this caſe obſerve the eye of the patient, for if there be a frequent motion of looking, raving is to be expected. When an artery beats ſtrongly in ſuch a place where it wonts not to be perceived, it ſhews a hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that there is much hot wind carried through the arteries, which when it aſſaults the brain, it cauſes madneſs; for thoſe things that paſs through the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries find an eaſie way of diſpatch through to the brain, through the jugular veins and the carotides, which are admitted into the very ventricle thereof. But when deliration is joyned with madneſs, there is in the mind a diſturbance, and much
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:153522:126"/>variety of imaginations, which cauſes the patient to move his eyes variouſly, as it were looking after thoſe things which he hath framed in his fancy.</p>

                  <p>EFFects. Principal actions. <hi>When cauſeleſs fear and ſadneſs enſues after cold, a convulſion is not far off.</hi> Hipp. in Coac.</p>
                  <p>Fear and ſadneſs are cauſed by a contraction and retreating of the ſpirits to their fountain, being oppreſſed with an abundance of melancholick humor, which makes them to be joyned with cold, and ſo that humor affecting the brain ſtirs up convulſions, unleſs the matter be evacuated by Hemorrhoids, varicles, or flowing of the moneths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Very fierce ravings end in convulſions.</hi> Hipp. in Coac.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leſs principal actions.</hi> For they are cauſed by a hot and dry diſtemper of the brain, which affects the roots of the nerves, bringing a convulſion that proceeds from drineſs along with it.</p>
                  <p>Sleep and waking. <hi>When upon a coldneſs a nocturnal fit ſucceeds, cauſing want of ſleep, joyned with fatuity, if ſometimes urine break forth in time of ſleeping, a convulſion enſues.</hi> Hipp. in Coac.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſymptomes ſignifie a running up of the matter to the brain, which threatens a convulſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An extraordinary and laſting pain of the head, the belly being bound, threatens a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews that the matter cauſing the diſeaſe is fixed in the head, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to the beginning of the nerves cauſes a convulſion.</p>
                  <p>Feeling. <hi>Deep and heavy pains in the arms and neck portend a convulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they proceed from an oppreſſion of the hinder parts of the brain, and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the humor into the marrow of the back-bone, or the membranes thereof, through the abundance of the matter, or maligne quality thereof, which extends it ſelf to the arms through the back, becauſe that nature cannot diſſolve or concoct the morbifick matter.</p>
                  <p>Excrements. Urine. <hi>A ſuppreſſion of the urine with coldneſs is evil; for it brings a convulſion, as well at other times, as alſo if a heavy ſleep do precede.</hi> Hipp. in Coac.</p>
                  <p>A convulſion eaſily enſues thoſe ſymptomatical coldneſſes with a ſuppreſſion of urine, becauſe they ſhew a running up of the humors to the brain, and original of the nerves; and that ſo much the more if the patient be at the ſame time ſleepy, which is a moſt evident ſigne of an affected brain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Urine which flows from the patient in ſleep not according to cuſtome, threatens a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews that the muſcle ſhutting up the neck of the bladder is grown weak, the motion whereof proceeds from the nerve, whoſe firſt original is out of order; unleſs that part be affected with ſome peculiar diſeaſe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Future relapſe in perſons recovering is manifeſted by the following rules.</p>
                  <p>The eſſence. <hi>Malignant and evil diſpoſed diſeaſes do not ſeldome relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they do very much weaken nature ſo that it ſcarcely can procure it ſelf a perfect freedome from the morbifick cauſe, but that there muſt remain ſome reliques of the diſeaſe which will produce a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes by how much the longer they endure, by ſo much the more they are lyable to a relapſe; and by how much the more acute they are, by ſo much the leſs they return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Continual diſeaſes proceed from a more thick and cold matter, which is the more difficultly concocted and evacuated. But acute diſeaſes proceed from a more thin matter, which is more eaſily prepared and evacuated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the feaver ſlackens upon a day which is not critical, it will return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as the critical dayes have a great influence upon the diſeaſe as to the curing thereof, becauſe then nature doth commodiouſly expel the morbifick humors; ſo thoſe diſſolutions which do happen on a not critical day, are alwaies treacherous, becauſe they agree not with the laws of nature orderly performing her work.</p>
                  <p>The internal cauſes. <hi>Diſeaſes that ariſe from black choler, with various, mixt, ſlimy, thick and ſtubborn humors, are wont to relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews that the humors are rebellious, and cannot be perfectly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by nature, which cauſes relapſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes which ariſe from blood, ſweet flegme, or pale choler, or other humors which have no malignant quality, and are ſimple, and which neither oppreſs the patient with their quantity, nor are thick or ſlimy, do not threaten any relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe that nature eaſily frees it ſelf from the trouble of theſe humors, which are not at all ſtubborn.</p>
                  <p>External. <hi>Thoſe diſeaſes that happen in the ſpring, winter, or at the beginning of the ſummer, ſeldome relapſe; but thoſe diſeaſes which come in Autumn are moſt lyable to relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in the winter and ſpring the native heat is moſt potent, and doth moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly diſſolve the noxious humors; but in Autumn is more weak and languid, by reaſon of the faintneſs induced by the heat of the foregoing ſummer, and therefore it is the more difficult wholly to expel the morbifick cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject. <hi>Thoſe perſons who have a good conſtitution of body, and are once reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a diſeaſe, never ſuffer relapſe; but perſons of a bad conſtitution often fall into it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in thoſe the ſtrength of the parts eaſily diſſolves the morbifick cauſe; but in theſe weak nature doth imperfectly expel the humor.</p>
                  <p>Helpful and hurtful. <hi>Thoſe that cannot regain perfect health, being helped but by few things, and hurt by many, are in danger of a relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this ſignifies that the reliques of the morbifick cauſe do lurk in the body, whence proceed relapſes.</p>
                  <p>Effects. <hi>If the actions, excrements, and qualities of perſons recovering differ much from the natural conſtitution, and return not to their former condition, a relapſe is to be feated; in thoſe whoſe feavers ceaſe without the ſignes of concoction, a recidivation is to be feared.</hi> Hipp. 2. prog.</p>
                  <p>The noxious humors cannot be conveniently expelled unleſs they be firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; and therefore although the feaver ceaſe, if the ſignes of crudity appear,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:153522:127"/>they ſhew that the morbifick matter is ſtill retained within, and will cauſe a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If after the Criſis is made the patient for a long time voyd thin water, and very little coloured, tis a ſigne of a relapſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it ſhews a weakneſs of nature, which doth not perfect its concoction duly and in order, whence ariſe new and freſh excrements by which we may expect a relapſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe are Aire, meat and drink, motion and reſt, ſleeping and waking, excretions and retentions, and the paſſions of the mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are called not natural, as being between natural and preternatural. For
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:153522:128"/>thoſe things are properly and abſolutely natural which are ingredients to the conſtitution of a living body, and are treated of in <hi>Phyſiology:</hi> but theſe are ſaid to be not natural, becauſe the right and true uſe of them preſerves the health, and then they are referred to natural cauſes; but the prepoſterous and unlawful uſe of them produces diſeaſes, and then they are preternatural, and the cauſes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all diſeaſes, as is declared in Pathology. But there are ſome of them that are contained in the rank of things truly natural, as motion of the body, paſſions of the mind, as the functions do proceed from their faculties; but being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the uſe of them affects the body, they are called not natural.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are alſo ſaid to be neceſſary, becauſe we cannot want nor be without their efficacy, but they do continually and neceſſarily affect our bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be <hi>objected,</hi> that there are many other things that do alter our bodies, which for this cauſe are to be numbred among thoſe things which are not natural, as the heaven, water, fire, earth, and the countrey, or place of abode; and therefore their number muſt be multiplied. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That the heaven, fire, earth, and countrey, are reduced to aire, becauſe they act not on us but by the mediation of air; water may be referred to drink, if it be aſſumed, but if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as in a bath, and lotions, we deny it to be a neceſſary, for that we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want it, and therefore it is to be raſed out of the catalogue of things not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>Therefore all this book ſhall treat wholly of the explication of the ſix things not natural, wherein ſhall be ſhewn how to make uſe of them for the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of health, and to defend the body as long as may be againſt the aſſaults of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes: we will begin with meat and drink, becauſe they are of moſt conſequence, and therein are moſt things do offer themſelves to conſideration.</p>

                     <hi>NOuriſhment is that which being changed by the natural heat, may be converted into the ſubſtance of our bodies, and nouriſh it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It differs from a medicine, in this, that a medicine is defined by Galen</hi> 1. ſimpl. <hi>to be a thing that cannot alter the ſubſtance of our body, nor as ſuch be changed into it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet there is a certain medium between theſe two, partaking of both natures, which may both nouriſh and alter, and it is called a medicinal nouriſhment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But there are ſeveral ſorts of nouriſhments, which are taken out of ſeveral things, all which things notwithſtanding are contained under the ſeveral ſorts of plants and animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All ſublunary things which are uſed in Phyſick are comprehended under a threefold head, as plants, animals, and minerals. Now every mixt thing endued with a nouriſhing faculty, muſt of neceſſity have had life; whereby minerals are excluded out of the number of things that nouriſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the uſe of them are to be conſidered the ſubſtance, quantity, quality, order, time, and hour of taking them; the preparation, cuſtom delectation, age, and time of the year.

                     <hi>BY the ſubſtance of the nouriſhments we underſtand the form and matter whereof they are compoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Under the word form we comprehend that propriety of the whole ſubſtance by which the nouriſhment is made fit to be converted into the ſubſtance of our bodies. Whence it is vulgarly ſaid that the meat doth nouriſh us by reaſon of the likeneſs of ſubſtance it hath with our bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence meats are ſaid to be of good or evil juyce, much or little nouriſhing, according to the analogy which they hold with the ſubſtance of our bodies, or according to their purity, or mixt compoſure of the heterogeneous parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the matter hardneſs ſoftneſs, thinneſs, thickneſs, heavineſs, lightneſs, craſſity, tenuity, clammineſs, and friability, are related; which although they be contained in the rank of ſecond qualities, yet becauſe they are inherent to the matter, and are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led material qualities (as proceeding from the various mixture of moiſture with drineſs) they are referred to ſubſtance, or mood of ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore as to the ſubſtance, thoſe are ſaid to be good and wholeſome nouriſhments which beget good and wholeſome juyce, and few excrements, and which are of a midling ſubſtance, as being neither over hard, thick, or cloſe, nor overſoft, thin, or fine. Of which ſort is bread made of the pureſt flour of wheat, new, well baked, and leavened; mutton, kids fleſh, veal, capons, hens, pullets, chickens, partridges, and other mountain birds; and other things which ſhall be more copiouſly reckoned up hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meats of evil juyce, hard to be concocted, of bad nouriſhment, and begetting many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, are thoſe which have a hard, thick, heavy, cloſe ſubſtance, as bread of bran, beef, goats, ſtags fleſh, pulſe, old cheeſe, and the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But theſe good or evil nouriſhments are not to be eſteemed generally wholeſome or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome to all men, but according to their various nature, way of life, and exerciſe; thoſe are more convenient for ſome, theſe for others: ſo thoſe who have a ſtronger heat, ſuch nouriſhments of hard digeſtion, as ox-fleſh, ſtags, hares, ſmoked meats, and the like, are more eaſily concocted. And on the contrary, meats of an eaſie digeſtion, as lamb, veal, ſoft eggs, freſh fiſh, and the like, are by them moſt difficultly concocted, as being rather corrupted and ſcorched up by the ſtrong heat of their ſtomachs; for as they are eaſily altered, ſo they are eaſily vitiated and corrupted. But the other which are commonly thought to be hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, as they are difficultly altered, ſo they are ſcarcely reduced to a worſe condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have the examples of this in thoſe things which are concocted outwardly, <hi>viz.</hi> hony, which is naturally moſt ſweet, but if it boyle beyond a fit time, it contracts a bitterneſs. On the contrary, beef and pork being long boyled are more ſavoury. Hony alſo is noxious to young men, becauſe it is ſcorched up by the heat of the ſtomach, and turned into choler. But it is wholeſome for aged men. becauſe it receives a fit concoction by the moderate heat of the ſtomach. For the ſame reaſon countrey-men, labouring-men, porters, mariners, and others exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at hard labourious trades are not ſo kindly nouriſhed with kids fleſh, veal, pullets, pigeons, and ſoft eggs; not onely becauſe the ſtronger heat of their ſtomachs ſo ſoon conſumes and diſſipates thoſe aliments, but becauſe it doth alſo over-concoct and corrupt them. On the contrary, they are more conveniently nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with pulſe, coleworts, cheeſe, beef, and ſuch like.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe quantity of aliments ought to be very moderate, onely as much as may ſuffice for the nouriſhment of the body, and refreſhing the ſtrength thereof. So that if the true limits be far exceeded, it produces various diſeaſes, and ſhortens life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as the multitude of meats begets many diſeaſes, ſo a ſparing diet, which is vulgarly called ſoberneſs and frugality, ſerves to prevent and cure many diſeaſes, and makes life long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief order of diet conſiſts in the moderate quantity thereof. For although the aliments ſhould be a little faulty in the ſubſtance, quality, and other conditions thereof, yet if they be taken in a ſmall quantity and well concocted, they nouriſh well. And therefore in the firſt place, we muſt take notice of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which moſt commonly is received in the exceſs. This is hence apparent that moſt diſeaſes are cured by bloud letting, purging, and other evacuations, by which the ſuperfluous multitude of humors is to be taken away, which proceeds from an abundance of meat aſſumed. Hence ſoberneſs and ſparing diet is called the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of health and long life. Whence <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 10. <hi>He that ſtudies his health muſt not over fil himſelf with meat, nor be idle and lazy:</hi> and again, <hi>Aph.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>where a man eats more meat then is ſufficient for nature, he brings him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to diſeaſes. Plato</hi> diſcovers an intemperate City by this ſign that it maintains many Phyſicians. Hence proceeds the Proverb, <hi>Intemperance is the nurſe of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi> As alſo that other, <hi>gluttony kills more then the ſword.</hi> But <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Our anceſtours were leſs troubled with diſeaſes becauſe they lived more frugally.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that the luxury and gluttony of his age called <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lyar, who affirmed that eunuchs and women were not troubled with pains of the gout. <hi>Ariſtotle in his Problems</hi> ſaith that it is moſt wholſome to diminiſh the quantity of meat, and to increaſe labour. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick was wont to ſay, that it was a fooliſh thing to begge that from the Gods which is in our power; while we pray to God for health, and preſently fall to glutting our ſelves with meat and drink. To all theſe we may adde the authority of holy Scripture, in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Be not greedy in thy banquets, and give not thy ſelf over to meat; for in much meat there is ſickneſs, and greedineſs will turn to choler. Many have died through fulneſs, but he that is temperate lengthens his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo may be made evident by clear examples. S. <hi>Paul</hi> the firſt hermite, as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> records in his life, lived to a hundred and fifteen years, of which he lived one hundred in the wilderneſs, for the firſt forty years eating nothing but dates, and drinking water; for the reſt of his time, after the dates failed him, upon half a loaf which a crow brought him every day.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> teſtifies, lived a hundred and five years, of which ninety he ſpent in the deſert, receiving no other ſuſtenance but onely bread and water, with which in his old age he now and then eat ſome herbs. <hi>Arſenius</hi> the tutor to <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperour, lived a hundred and twenty years, fifty five of which he ſpent in the deſert, with a wonderful temperance and abſtinency. In our age <hi>Ludovicus Carnarus,</hi> a noble Venetian, having been very unhealthy to the thirty fifth year of his age, though he uſed many medicines, in vain ſtriving with many diſeaſes at length by the advice of a certain Phyſician he began to oppoſe his diſeaſes by diet, diminiſhing by little and little the quantity of his meat and drink till he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:153522:129"/>came to fourteen ounces of meat, and bread, or the like, and ſixteen ounces of drink in a day; to which order of diet accuſtoming himſelf, he by this temperance prolonged his life, being free from diſeaſes, and vigorous to above one hundred years. As himſelf teſtifies in <hi>a book of the profit of a ſober life,</hi> written by him in the Italian tongue, and tranſlated after both into Latin and French. From which we gather, that ſparing diet doth not onely extraordinarily avail to keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health in a good condition, but alſo to expel durable and pertinacious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. For after the natural heat hath concocted that ſmall quantity of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then it works upon the ſuperfluous humors, digeſting and diſſipating them, cauſing them inſenſibly to exhale through the paſſages of the body, which renders the body pure and free from morbifical cauſes. Now while a man perſiſts in this courſe of diet, the body is made free from diſeaſes, at leaſt in reſpect of internal cauſes. Which if it be endangered by external cauſes, the harme is leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe the body being free from ſuperfluities is better able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And therefore we ſee in great alterations of ſeaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> when from a ſouthern, hot and moiſt conſtitution of the aire, a ſwift and ſudden alteration is made into the north, being cold and dry, that many are troubled with Catarrhs, Pleuriſies, or peripneumonies, in whoſe bodies was hoorded up much matter for diſeaſes; but others are not troubled whoſe bodies are void of ſuperfluous humors. And if ſometimes ſuch perſons through the vehemency of external cauſes be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to any diſeaſe, they recover ſo much the ſooner, by reaſon that the internal cauſe moved by the external is of no great force, which is therefore the more eaſily vanquiſhed and reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if this exact diet do not altogether take away the diſeaſe, yet it very much impairs the vehemency, thereof and makes it more tolerable, ſo that the patient may live long enough to ſtruggle with the diſeaſe. And thus daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience informs us many live long with an ulcer in their lungs, with a ſcirrhus in their liver or ſpleen, with the ſtone in their reines or bladder; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>in his Problems,</hi> ſaying, that there was a certain Philoſopher in his time, by name <hi>Herodicus,</hi> who was in a conſumption, yet by well dieting himſelf lived to a hundred years.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly <hi>objected,</hi> that many live to a very great age that are very liberal in their diet. To this we <hi>anſwer,</hi> that thoſe are very few, and endued with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrength and good temper of body, who if they ſhould live ſoberly would produce their lives to a much longer age, and be better diſpoſed to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind. For of neceſſity thoſe that live intemperately muſt abound with ill humors, and be often aſſailed with diſeaſes, nor can long intend the high and difficult functions of the mind without manifeſt impairing of their health. For in thoſe perſons the ſtrength of nature and the ſpirits is wholly enſlaved to the concoction of the nouriſhment, from which if it be violently drawn by the ſtudious labours of the mind, the concoction cannot be good; whence follow many diſeaſes and crudities, becauſe they require much exerciſe, or phyſick to purge the body; and ſo though they ſeem to live long in their body, yet their mindes and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeem already interr'd, being unable to hold out long in the performance of thoſe noble functions, the greateſt part of their time being to be ſpent in drudging for the body. Add to this, that though it may happen that ſuch as are endued with a ſtrong nature may live long with ſuch profuſe diet, yet we find no examples that weaker conſtitutions uſing the ſame diet, would ever live to old age. But on the contrary, if they live temperately they may live longer then ſuch as indulge themſelves to intemperancy, though of ſtronger nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this moderate and neceſſary quantity of meat cannot be preſcribed by any general
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:153522:130"/>rule, the diverſity of times, ages, and tempers, cauſing much alteration in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this theorem is ſhewn that the example of <hi>Ludovicus Cornarus</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is not to be followed by all men, for there are many men whoſe natural heat is ſtrong and vigorous, which would be much damnifyed by ſuch a ſparing diet. For <hi>Hipp.</hi> writes <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>book Aph.</hi> 5. that a diet too ſtrict and ſparing is more dangerous then that which exceeds a little; for it is an eaſier thing to have remedies againſt the plenty of humors, then to repair the natural moiſture, and the waſting of the ſolid parts by aliments. A threefold order of diet is inſtituted by <hi>Hipp. and Galen; ſparing,</hi> which diminiſheth the ſtrength; <hi>moderate,</hi> which preſerves it; <hi>and full,</hi> which increaſes it. Sparing diet is not convenient for healthful people, but onely for the ſick. <hi>For as meat is health to the healthy; ſo it is a diſeaſe to diſeaſed perſons: and by how much the more you nouriſh unſound bodies, by ſo much the more you hurt them.</hi> In healthy people the ſtrength of nature is to be preſerved or increaſed with nouriſhment, not to be broken; which cannot be in ſick perſons, becauſe a moderate diet preſerving the health in healthy people, diminiſheth it in thoſe that are ſick, by increaſing the diſeaſe; becauſe by how much the more you feed it, by ſo much the more you hurt the body of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And therefore ſo exact a diet as was obſerved by <hi>Cornarus</hi> is not convenient for all men, but onely to ſuch as are ſickly, and whoſe natural heat is weak, and not able to concoct much meat, and alſo to ſuch whoſe bodies are full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, for hunger dries up the body; as alſo laſtly to thoſe that uſe little exerciſe, leading a ſedentary life, being addicted to contemplation, and the tough labours of the mind. Yet there are certain rules which may be ſet down, by which every man may preſcribe to himſelf a certain and convenient diet at all times.</p>
                  <p>The firſt theorem is, <hi>That a man in health muſt never eat to ſatiſfie, but riſe from the table while his appetite is ſtill quick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule anſwers to the <hi>afore cited Aph.</hi> of <hi>Hipp. do not clog your ſelf with meat.</hi> For in healthy perſons the appetite will be lively till the ſtomach be very much filled; which repletion is very hurtful, as we have ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Theorem is, <hi>If you ordinarily take ſo much meat, til you find a kind of drowſineſs, heavineſs, and wearineſs, when as you were before nimble and cheerful, it is a ſigne you have exceeded your accuſtomed meaſure, and that you muſt diminiſh the quantity of your meat till you find no more of thoſe inconveniencies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Theorem is, <hi>If after meals you be unfit for the actions of the mind, as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, meditation or contemplation, and other functions of the mind and body, then it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent you have exceeded your due proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth theorem <hi>is taken from</hi> Hipp. 3. <hi>Of diet, where he propoſeth the ſignes of repletion, which proceeds from too great a quantity of meat eaten, and is therefore to be diminiſhed; nay if it do ſo much exceed, that it threaten a diſeaſe, ſeeing that ſparing diet doth conſume the ſuperflous humors but very gently, the fulneſs muſt be taken away by evacuations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſignes of repletion propounded by</hi> Hipp. <hi>are here to be briefly ſet down, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into order according to the method of our ſemeiotical diſcourſe, that they may be the better underſtood. They are theſe; pain and heavineſs in the head, long and troubled ſleeps, troubleſome dreams, when a man imagins himſelf to be fighting, ſleep in the daytime, chiefly after meals, lazineſs of the whole body, wearineſs, and pain either in the whole, or in any part thereof, want or decreaſe of appetite, crudities in the ſtomach, ſowre or inodorous belches, and hard binding of the belly, or more then was wont to be, frequent diſtillations, the noſe ſtopt after ſupper, yet with little or no excrement proceeding thence, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much excrement at the noſe, and much ſpitting, uncuſtomary abundance of wind,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153522:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>looſneſs of the body proceeding ſometimes from the meat corrupted, ſometimes from a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth theorem is, <hi>That you muſt not immediately change from a full courſe of diet to an exact and ſparing one, but you muſt do it by degrees, phyſically diminiſhing it by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with drawing from the wonted quantity, until you come to ſuch a proportion, as doth no more offend, neither the body, nor the functions of the mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This theorem is confirmed by <hi>Hipp. in the</hi> 51. <hi>Aph.</hi> 2. <hi>To evacuate or fill much and ſuddenly, to cool, heat, or any other way to move the body is dangerous. For every exceſs is an enemy to nature, but that which is done by degrees is ſafe, as at other times, ſo when you paſs from one thing to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the diſcrete quantity belongs the variety of meats, which is very prejudical to health. For the nature of ſeveral meats being various, it follows that ſome are ſooner ſome more ſlowly digeſted, which cauſes an evil concoction; For if the meats more eaſily concocted are after perfect concoction detained in the ſtomach, they preſently corrupt; but if as ſoon as they are concocted, they are thruſt down to the inteſtines, they carry along with them the other meats not fully concocted, which is the cauſe of many crudities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This theorem is to be underſtood of ſeveral ſorts of meat much differing in their nature and temper. For it is no inconvenience to eat at the ſame meal chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, partridge, pullets, and other ſuch kind of delicates; but if you preſent to the ſtomach an olio of fleſh, fiſh, herbs, fruit, and ſuch kind of heterogeneous diet, there follows thence an evil concoction. <hi>Hipp. lib. de flat. Things unlike move diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,</hi> for ſome are ſooner, others ſlower, others hard to be concocted. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith elegantly, <hi>ſeveral ſorts of meat defile, but nouriſh not.</hi>

                     <hi>IF you rightly obſerve the laſt Theorem propounded in the ſecond chapter, that is, to ſhun variety of differing meats at the ſame meal as hurtful; there will be no need of this chapter: but becauſe the intemperance of men will not ſulmit to ſuch ſtrict laws of diet, we are forced to ſet down precepts how to diminiſh the harm that comes thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the common and general rule concerning the order of diet is, that thin, liquid, eaſily to be concocted, looſening meats, and which eaſily deſcend, ſhould be firſt taken; and thoſe which are more thick and ſolid, of difficult concoction and binding, laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule is taken from <hi>Galen in l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Alim. facult. c.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>of the manner of diet in acute diſeaſes.</hi> And it is alſo much confirmed by reaſon. For thoſe which are quickly concocted, as moiſt and liquid things, more eaſily paſs from the ſtomach, and if they be retained after concoction they putrifie. Alſo after they are concocted, and thruſt down to the gut called Duodenum, they give place to thoſe things which are not yet concocted, to fall down to the bottom of the ſtomach, where they may be better concocted. But although this doctrine be very much received, yet ſome have endeavoured to prove the contrary, becauſe that the meats ſolid and of hard digeſtion want a greater heat which is at the bottom of the ſtomach, being more fleſhy, and therefore being put firſt in they will be concocted in the ſame ſpace of time as thoſe which are of more eaſie concoction, lying at the top of the ſtomach where there is leſs heat. But there is not ſo much difference in the heat of the lower and upper part of the ſtomach, that in one meats of eaſie, in the other meats of hard digeſtion ſhould be in the ſame time concocted. It is rather to be affirmed, that the nouriſhment does not keep the ſame ſeat in the ſtomach all the time of the concoction as it had when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, but by concoction it is mixed together, it being the property of heat to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gegate things of like nature. And experience tels us, that an uniform chyle in all parts alike is begot out of the whole nouriſhment. Add alſo to this, that the drink which is powred down at ſeveral times at dinner and ſupper, is exactly mixed with the meat, and the like is alſo to be ſaid of broths and other ſuch like liquid meats. Therefore this rule as to the ordering of diet is of no great value. But it is much better not to indulge to this variety of meat, when one ſort of meat, or ſeveral of the ſame nature, are orderly concocted together; there being no danger of crudities, if they be uſed and eaten moderately. But this is to be affirmed, that moiſt and looſening meats being firſt taken, do looſen the tunicles of the ſtomach, and ſoften the belly, but things that are aſtringent do ſtreighten them, if they be taken in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At the beginning of the meal, ſome broth, or morſel of fleſh, or ſome other nouriſhment actually hot is to be taken; but let a man never drink firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this rule is repugnant the common verſe of the <hi>Salern</hi> ſchool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If danger thou'lt avoid, and no pain feel,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be ſure to take a cup before thy meal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:153522:131"/>
                  <p>But this is not to be underſtood of water and wine, for otherwiſe it were wholly to be rejected; but of liquid nouriſhment: in which ſenſe alſo <hi>Hipp.</hi> uſes the word <hi>drink. Aph.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Sect.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>it is eaſier to be filled with drink then meat.</hi> By drink he there means liquid nouriſhment which is to be dranke, ſuch as is given to people in feavers, which in another place he calls moiſt diet; for they are more eaſily concocted, and diſſipated, and conſequently fill the body ſooner. But the ordinary drink compoſed of water and wine being dranke firſt, is carried raw to the veins, eſpecially being faſting, and ſtrikes the nerves; and moſt of all if you drink wine. For to drink water before meals, eſpecially where people have hot ſtomachs, and in the ſummer time, is not inconvenient, for that water is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drank up by the dry liver, whence it receives a cool refreſhing.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the cuſtome of the ancients alledged by ſome impugne this rule at all, which is reported by <hi>Atheneus book</hi> 4 <hi>Deipnoſoph.</hi> that formerly there were ſet before the gueſts twenty ſilver cups, which being emptied, the bread and meat was preſently brought in. He in the quoted place, deſcribing the frugality of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſaith, that there was given but one cup to the gueſts before ſupper. With the Latines alſo this cuſtome was obſerved, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 22. that in <hi>Tiberius Claudius</hi> his reign, above forty years before, it was an inſtitution to drink faſting; and that the wine was uſually brought in before the meat: but it was a pernicious cuſtome, and to be condemned, as being uſed no where but in profuſe and intemperate banquetings, nor admitted into the company of ſober men; which <hi>Pliny</hi> intimates, ſaying, that this cuſtome was introduced by external and forregin arts, and preſcriptions of Phyſicians that would commend themſelves by bringing in novelties. It is diſapproved by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch l.</hi> 8. <hi>ſympoſ. queſt.</hi> 9. where he reckons theſe carowſings before meat among the cauſes of diſeaſes. <hi>The ancients, ſaith he, drank not ſo much as water before meat; now before they eat, full of wine, with a moiſtened and hot ſtomach they fall to their meat.</hi> It is moſt wholeſome to take ſolid meats before drink, till thirſt be ſtirred up, and thoſe actually hot, leſt they offend the heat of the ſtomach; and that they may be as it were a firme foundation for the reſt of the meat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to conclude, the meat with drink is not inconvenient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a thing of no great moment whether you eat or drink laſt; but this is to be noted, that you muſt not drink too great a quantity, for it makes a fluctuation in the ſtomach; but if after the concluſion of the meal, you find any kind of thirſt, it will not be a miſs to drink. <hi>Celſus</hi> is of opinion, that it is good to drink a draught of cold water after meals; which is not contrary to reaſon, ſeeing that it lightly binds up the orifice of the ſtomach by its coldneſs, and gathers the heat cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by antiperiſtaſis, binding the aſcent of vapours; for experience teaches that the rank ſteam of ſome meats, as of onions, garlike, old cheeſe, and the like, is kept from the head by a draught of cold water after meals.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the time and hour of eating.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THe time and hour of eating depends altogether upon cuſtome; for if one have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf to eat twice or thrice in a day, and at certain houres, and finds himſelf well with it, he may continue ſo doing till he find any occaſion to alter his mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can be no certain rule ſet down concerning the hour and time of eating, but firſt you muſt take it from cuſtome, which hath ſuch an influence upon nature, that at the hour of eating the hungry ſtomach will be an exact remembrancer to healthy perſons. But after that hour their appetite will grow faint, and their hunger leave them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the hour of dinner and ſupper coming, it is neceſſary that the appetite ſhould be very quick, to ſhew that the meat laſt eaten be throughly concocted. For otherwiſe it will be neceſſary to omit that hour, and to eat nothing or very little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The intent of this rule, that you do not eat again until the meat already in the ſtomach be very well concocted, and fallen down to the guts; for then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is reinforced, and concoction is afterwards very well made. But if you eat again before the former meat be throughly concocted, the concoction is ſpoiled, and it is the cauſe of many crudities. But this onely concerns thoſe who on ſome extraordinary occaſion, as at ſome banquet, have eaten too largely; but then it would be very neceſſary to abſtain from the next meal, or to be content with one draught of drink, and a very ſmall portion of meat. For if it ſhould happen that in the ordinary cuſtome of eating, the appetite ſhould be lively at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed hour, and that there were other ſignes of inconcoction of the former meal, tis to be ſuſpected that too great a quantity of meat was taken, which ought to be diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there being a certain time of eating to be fixed to the greater number of men, we judge that it is moſt convenient to eat twice a day. For more frequent eating begets cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. And a longer abſtinence weakens the body, and draws down humors to the ſtomach, which may cauſe many bad affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greateſt part of men are contented with a dinner and a ſupper, many notwithſtanding add a breakfaſt, and others a bever alſo; which is moſt uſed by children and old men; by children, becauſe as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches, <hi>they have much natural heat, and conſequently have need of much nouriſhment:</hi> by aged men, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but a weak heat, they ought to eat but little at a time for the eaſier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, that the body may be ſufficiently nouriſhed. But long faſting is naught, eſpecially for ſuch as are troubled with bitter choler, becauſe the ſtomach being empty is filled with cholerick humors, which cauſe pains of the heart, bilious colicks, and other diſeaſes. But in other men, an empty ſtomach, not having matter to concoct, draws what it finds from the adjoyning places, and ſo fills it ſelf with ill humors, whence proceed many diſeaſes: and therefore after much faſting it is better to take away ſomewhat every meal from the quantity of meat, then to uſe long faſting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſupper in ſome perſons that are healthy, and in the flower of their youth, ought either to be equal, or larger then the dinner; but in all others more ſparing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion in the whole art of phyſick more controverted, then whether ſupper ought to be larger then dinner, or the contrary; which uſhers in another
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:153522:132"/>difficult queſtion, whether concoction be ſooneſt perfected in the day or the night, aſleep, or waking: for they do both muſter up their arguments with equal force.</p>
                  <p>And that the ſupper ought to be the larger is proved out of <hi>Hipp.</hi> 3. <hi>of diet,</hi> where he teaches to eat but once a day in the winter, unleſs you have a very dry belly. If that cannot be done, he bids us eat but a ſmal dinner, whence tis eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, by that one meal which <hi>Hipp.</hi> preſcribes in the winter, he means a ſupper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celſus</hi> following <hi>Hipp. In the winter, ſaith he, men ought to eat but once in a day, unleſs the belly be very much bound.</hi> And after that he addes; <hi>If a man dine, ſome ſmall matter were moſt convenient, and that dry, without fleſh or drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> 7. <hi>Meth.</hi> c. 6. expreſly ſaith, that ſupper ought to be greater then the dinner, and gives this reaſon, that after ſupper comes reſt and ſleep, and longer time, double to that which is between dinner and ſupper. From theſe words of <hi>Galen</hi> a threefold reaſon may be gathered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> in reſt the body is not moved, nor toſſed up and down, ſo that the meat may lye aptly in the ſtomach, not fluctuating nor ſtirred from place to place; which helps concoction, becauſe concoction requires reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in ſleep, the animal ſpirits keeping holiday, the vital and natural become more ſtrong and lively, which much helps forward the concoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the time being double between dinner and ſupper, the nouriſhment alſo ought to be double.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to theſe reaſons <hi>Galen</hi> adds the example of the wreſtlers, who eat much fleſh at ſupper, but at dinner onely bread. To <hi>Galens</hi> the following reaſons may be added.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the coldneſs of the night promotes concoction. For this like the winter renders the ſtomach and belly more ſtrong, driving the heat inward, whereby to perfect the concoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it is proved that in ſleep the heat runs to the center, by the authority of <hi>Hipp.</hi> 1. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 4. who ſaith, that a man waking is hotter about the exteriour parts, and colder about the inner parts: but in thoſe that ſleep it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; which appears alſo by the pulſe, and breath, which are ſtronger ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then waking.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, that dinner ought to be larger is proved by the following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and authorities. The authorities are taken from <hi>Actuarius</hi> and <hi>Avicen,</hi> who adviſe to divide our meat into three parts, two whereof muſt be eaten at dinner, and the third at ſupper. To which may be added the verſes of the <hi>Salern</hi> ſchoole, which are in Engliſh thus;

                           <l>If you deſire a quiet night,</l>
                           <l>Make a ſupper ſhort and light.</l>

                  <p>Their authorities are ſettled upon ſtrong reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> between dinner and ſupper there are but ſeven or eight hours at moſt, between ſupper and dinner about ſixteen. But if ſleep were advantageous for concoction, it would be perfected about the middle of the night, and hunger would immediately ſucceed. But on the contrary, when a man riſes out of his bed in the morning he is leſs hungry then before ſupper; which makes it clear, that concoction is more ſlowly performed in ſleep then in waking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſleep after dinner, in thoſe that are not accuſtomed to it, cauſes the appetite not to be ſo quick at the hour of ſupper, and a ſenſible oppreſſion of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:153522:133"/>the ſtomach by meat, which ſhews that concoction is moſt imperfect in ſleep. For if ſleep helped concoction, it would be alike profitable to all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> thoſe that wake are moſt hungry; whence <hi>Hipp.</hi> 6. <hi>Epid. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 20. calls it <hi>greedy watchfulneſs.</hi> So thoſe that watch beyond their cuſtome till late at night, ſooner perceive hunger: ſo thoſe that preſs out wine and oyle, becauſe they are perpetually awake, they eat much and often.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if ſleep did promote concoction, a man ought then to ſleep preſently after meals, becauſe the meat being then more ſolid requires the greateſt heat of the ſtomach, and becauſe the firſt hours work is hardeſt; but this is all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed waking, otherwiſe the ſtomach would be much oppreſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> thoſe who have a weak ſtomach, and a bad digeſttion are more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by night after the firſt ſleep, then by day in the afternoon; which argues that in ſleep concoction is difficult.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, Celſus</hi> adviſeth that in the long dayes it is better to ſleep at noon before meat, for no other reaſon doubtleſs, but becauſe ſleep retards concoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> in ſleep the heat runs to its fountains, but the other parts are left deſtitute, more then in waking; and when a man is awake the heat is more equally diffuſed through the whole body, and therefore there is leſs heat in the ſtomach when a man ſleeps then when he wakes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly,</hi> in the daytime the heat of the ſun advantageth concoction. For the ſun, as <hi>Ariſt.</hi> affirmes 2. <hi>Phyſ.</hi> 2. is the fountain of life. And therefore concoction in the day hath a double heat, which that which is done by night wants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> the ſituation of the ſtomach in thoſe that are awake makes more to the furtherance of concoction, becauſe an upright poſture cauſes the meat to deſcend more eaſily to the bottom of the ſtomach, which is more fleſhy; but in thoſe that ly, it onely touches the ſides thereof, ſo that the mouth of the ſtomach cannot ſhut as it ſhould do. And therefore ſleeping at noon hurts leſs in a poſture of ſitting then lying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> the flegme which in the day-time is expelled at the noſtrilles and throat, in the night flows down into the ſtomach, and retards the concoction, which inconvenience moleſts not thoſe that wake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> experience confirmes this for a truth; for there are very few men who will not ingenuouſly confeſs that they find themſelves better after a light then great ſupper. And <hi>Cardan</hi> teſtifies, that he did aſke many men that lived to a hundred years, who told him that they uſed very ſlender ſuppers. To theſe we may adde the example of <hi>Telephus</hi> the Grammarian, related by <hi>Galen,</hi> 5. <hi>of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving health,</hi> who lived almoſt to a hundred years. His words are theſe; <hi>He eat raw hony mixed with rice pottage about the third hour of the day, about the ſeventeenth he dined, uſing ſalads firſt, then river fiſh, or birds. In the evening he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely with bread ſopped in wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We therefore convicted by the force of theſe latter reaſons, and much more by daily experience, do believe that ſuppers ought to be more ſparing then dinners; yet we grant, as in the <hi>theorems</hi> is mentioned, that thoſe who are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, and have a ſtrong ſtomach, may either eat as much or more at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then at dinner, ſo that the whole quantity of both meals do not exceed moderation; for they have a good concoction both night and day. And here may be repeated the ſentence of <hi>Celſus, that a man in perfect health need not ty himſelf to any laws:</hi> Nay if a man of a weaker conſtitution uſeth but little aliment, and take a leſs quantity at dinner, he may doubtleſs make a better meal at ſupper. Whereby the whole quantity of meat which is taken in one day may ſuffice for
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:153522:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>the nouriſhment of the whole body. But if we conſider the cuſtome of men now a dayes, who eat their fill at dinner, certainly they would be very much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſhould they eat largly at ſupper. And then the mentioned verſes of the <hi>Salern</hi> ſchool are verified.</p>
                  <p>But this rule is chiefly to be underſtood of thoſe who are ſubject to fluxes and catarrhs; for by night the flegmy humor flows from the brain into the ſtomach, and diſturbs the concoction. On the contrary, if you eat but little meat at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the pituitous humor is conſumed by the natural heat, and is not ſo eaſily increaſed again, as in thoſe that ſup largly, becauſe from the abundance of meat many vapours do ariſe from the ſtomach to the head. And thoſe that are ſo affected after a light ſupper ſleep quietly: but if they eat large ſuppers, their ſleep is unquietly and interrupted, ſo that the greateſt part of them are forced to eat but moderately, and ſome to abſtain altogether from eating at night. Hence it was wiſely ſaid by <hi>Manardus, Epiſt.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 6. a light ſupper is profitable for the eyes and head.</p>
                  <p>But that this truth may be more clear, we muſt give ſome ſatisfaction as to the authorities and reaſons brought to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> to the authorities of <hi>Hipp. Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> we oppoſe, that tis true, we are by them ſatisfied, that it was the cuſtome of the ancients to eat little at dinner, much at ſupper: nevertheleſs becauſe they eat very little at dinner, they had more reaſon to eat largly at ſupper. And indeed that meal taken at ſupper had need of more time for concoction then if taken at dinner. But in our times when dinners are ſo large, we cannot imitate the ancients at ſupper. And without doubt the ancients had done better if what they did eat at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they had eaten at dinner, and if that which they took at dinner they had taken at ſupper. To this may be added that their hour of ſupper was not the ſame with ours; for the Romans uſing to dine but ſparingly, and eating a little in the morning, did ſup three hours before ſun-ſet, ſo that they had almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted their meat before they went to ſleep.</p>
                  <p>But to the <hi>firſt reaſon</hi> alledged in oppoſition to this opinion we <hi>anſwer,</hi> that all ſort of reſt is not ſo convenient to help forward concoction, when as a ſoft and gentle motion after meals cauſeth the meat to deſcend to the bottom ofthe ſtomach, and ſtirs up the natural heat, that it may the better intend its work. Hence the vulgar verſe,
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>After ſupper ſtand a while.</l>
                           <l>Or elſe walk a mile.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>ſecond we ſay,</hi> that the vital ſpirits indeed are more ſtrong in ſleep, but that they do not flow into the ſtomach and other parts in that abundance, as when a man wakes; for in ſleep they retire to their fountains, but when a man wakes they are diffuſed abroad.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>the third we anſwer,</hi> that the double ſpace of time coming betwen dinner and ſupper, would require a double proportion of nouriſhment if the digeſtion were equally made in both meals. But becauſe the digeſtion is not ſo ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched after ſupper, as we have ſhewn, that longer time was neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the fourth we ſay,</hi> that the conſtitution of wreſtlers is not commended by <hi>Galen,</hi> 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 3. and <hi>in lib. of good habit of body in ſuaſ. to arts,</hi> nay he ſaith that they are ſhort lived, and full of diſeaſes. To reſtore and fatten the body, meat
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:153522:134"/>eaten at ſupper doth more avail, but it produces diſeaſes from the plenty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that proceed from that courſe of diet. And therefore perſons recovering from a diſeaſe are more refreſhed by a larger ſupper, but they are in greater danger of a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>the fifth and ſixth we ſay,</hi> that in ſleep the heat draws to the center, and retires to its fountains, <hi>viz.</hi> the heart and liver. Hence better concoctions are made in the veines and arteries; whence, there is nothing more profitable then ſleep to concoct evil humors in continual feavers, and there is nothing which more hinders the concoction of them then waking continually. Hence drunkards are ſaid to ſleep away their ſurfits fulneſs of crudity which are cauſed in the veins by an over-repletion of drink. But there is a far different reaſon for the concoction in the ſtomach, which proceeds more imperfectly when nature is intent upon the diſtribution of meats already concocted, as alſo on the digeſtion of the evil humors; from which work it is not a little diſtracted by the concoction of the meats in the ſtomach, eſpecially if there be any quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt ſeaſonable hour of dining is about two or three hours before noon, which is much wholeſomer then either at noon, or after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By dining at a ſeaſonable hour we gain two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a longer time till ſupper, that the firſt concoction may be perfected. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe it is then colder which is moſt to be aimed at in ſummer) which coldneſs helps concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> for that a man is ſtronger, becauſe nearer the hour of his laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, ſleep, which produced many new ſpirits, which render the whole body more ſtrong, and cheerful; and we ſee every where that thoſe who take their meat in beſt ſeaſon live longeſt, and that thoſe who dine later, are more diſeaſed, and of a ſhorter life.</p>

                     <hi>SOme meats require an artificial preparation to fit them for the nouriſhment of the body; and others are ſufficiently prepared by nature, that we may take them juſt as nature preſents them to us: of the firſt ſort are fleſh, and fiſh, and the like; of the latter, all ripe fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The preparation of meats is performed by coction, which is threefold, boyling, roſting, frying, or broyling,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boyling is twofold, either when things are boyled in water, and then they retain the name of boyling, ſo that fleſh in this manner prepared is called boyled; or elſe when they ſeeth them in their own liquor over a gentle fire, and then they are called pottage-meats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celſus writes, that pottage-meats do nouriſh more then roſted, and thoſe more then fryed. But we adde, that boyled meats nouriſh leaſt of all, becauſe they loſe much of their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juyce in the pottage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet boyling is more praiſed as to the common uſe, becauſe that which is loſt in the fleſh is found in the broth. Then alſo fleſh grows ſofter by boyling, ſo that it is more eaſily diſſolved and concocted in the ſtomach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roaſting of mutton is the better, if firſt the fleſh be beaten with a wooden peſtle, as is cuſtomary with cookes; for ſo it becomes more tender, and looſe, and more eaſie to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated

                     <hi>MEats to which a man accuſtomes himſelf, though they are not ſo good, yet are more profitable then unwonted diet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This theorem is confirmed by <hi>Hipp.</hi> 50. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. where he ſaith, <hi>that thoſe things to which a man is accuſtomed by long time, though worſe, yet are leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then things to which a man is unaccuſtomed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For cuſtome is a ſecond nature, ſeeing that meats uſed a long time do alter nature, and render it of the ſame likeneſs. By <hi>nature</hi> we underſtand the temper of the body, which becomes like the nouriſhment to which it is long accuſtomed. Now the force of this cuſtome is proved by many examples in many authors. One onely ſhall ſuffice us; related by <hi>Solenander. Phyſ. Counſ. Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Coun.</hi> 15. of a certain countryman, who being brought to the hoſpital could be cured by no remedies: at length as he was about to dye the Phyſician asked him what kind of diet he had formerly uſed; He made anſwer, that he was very much averſe to that meat and drink, and ſyrups, and ſoft bed which they then uſed him to, whereas before he had not ſlept for nineteen years in a bed; and for his diet had uſed altogether onions, and cheeſe, and ſuch like, and had ſlept in the open aire onely upon ſtraw. The Phyſician permitted him one night to ſleep in ſtraw, and to eat onions and ſalt, and to drink cold water; and although he thought this would the ſooner kill him, yet contrary to the opinion of all men, the next day he found him ſitting at the fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe and cuſtome is to be obſerved not onely in the ſubſtance, bt alſo in the quality and quantity of meat, and time of eating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule alſo is borrowed from <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>It is to be conſidered,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who ought to eat twice or oncea day, and where to give more or leſs; for much way is to be giving to the time, country, cuſtome, and age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When meats to which the body is accuſtomed, being bad, do upon any occaſion hurt the body, they are to be changed, and others which are better muſt be uſed, ſo it be done by degrees; for every ſudden alteration is dangerous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For many cauſes do manifeſt that the change of diet is ſometimes neceſſary, as when by ſuch or ſuch diet it appears that the diſeaſes are cheriſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: ſometimes age coming on is not able to concoct ſuch meats as were eaſily digeſted in youth; therefore if it ſeem neceſſary for any cauſe to change the courſe of diet, it muſt be done by a little and a little; which <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches <hi>Aph.</hi> 51. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>to empty or fill much and ſuddenly, to heat, or cool, or to make any other kind of ſubitaneous alteration in the body is dangerous, for every exceſs is hurtful to nature; but that which is done by degrees is ſafe, as at other times, ſo when we proceed from one thing to another.</hi> This may be confirmed by many examples, but eſpecially by
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:153522:135"/>the example of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was much given to luxury and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs. Who being beſieged, and compelled by neceſſity, finding that he muſt leave his wonted cuſtome of drinking, ſuddenly left it off; which when he had done a little while, he fell into a conſumption, neither could he recover till he fell to his accuſtomed manner of drinking again. Though had he left that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome by degrees, he could have received no dammage at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe meats are firſt to be preferred which are moſt pleaſing to a man, though they be not altogether ſo good as thoſe which he doth any way loath.</hi> This <hi>Hipp.</hi> expreſly teaches <hi>Aph.</hi> 38. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Meat and drink, though it be not ſo good, yet if it be more pleaſing, is to be preferred before that which is not ſo, though it be better in quality.</hi> For when the meat is acceptable to the palate, it is more welcome to the ſtomach, and the ſtomach more quickly and readily concocts it. On the contrary, it rejects that which is not ſo acceptable, ſo that it neither receives it with greedineſs, nor concocts it with expedition. Under the protection of this Aphoriſme many flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Phyſicians do ſhelter themſelves, who to gratifie their patients deny them nothing that they covet. But they erre ſhamefully, and are condemned by <hi>Galen l.</hi> 12. <hi>method. c.</hi> 1. <hi>As,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſhews himſelf to be cruel, that takes awaythe life of the patient with the diſeaſe, ſo he that perpetually indulges to the palate of the patient, regarding his pleaſure, not his health, is a flatterer. And</hi> 1. <hi>meth. c.</hi> 1. he inveighs much againſt thoſe flatterers. <hi>Thoſe that give cold water if the patient require it, who waſh when they bid, who give wine and ſnow when they demand it, like obedient ſlaves, contrary to thoſe ancient Phyſicians who were the true ſons of Aeſculapius, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned their patients as captains do their ſouldiers, or Kings their ſubjects; and would not obey like</hi> Getes, <hi>Phrygian and Thracian ſlaves.</hi> Therefore that there may be a certain proportion ſet down for theſe things which may be given to ſick people, <hi>Hipp.</hi> is to be conſulted, who thus ſpeaks 6. <hi>Epid.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe are the things wherein the patient may be gratified, and that the meat and drink may be purely tempered, that what they ſee may be acceptable, and what they feel ſoft, but that they may do no harme, or ſuch as may be eaſily repaired; as the giving them cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where need requires, and the like:</hi> where theſe words are particularly to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>which may not do any harme, or ſuch as may be eaſily repaired;</hi> for if thoſe things which the patient requires will do any conſiderable miſchief, they are utterly to be rejected.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon of this Aphoriſme is, becauſe the body being ſoft and tender, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof is conſumed by the great heat, which muſt be repaired by ſtore of nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By youths and young men a midling diet both as to the quantity and the quality is to be uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Youths and young men have a more moderate temper, and therefore to be nouriſhed with temperate diet, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as hath a moderate proportion of the firſt qualities. The quantity of them alſo ought to be moderate, that is, leſs then in children, and more then is uſed in other ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Young men, becauſe they are extremely hot and dry, are to uſe contrary diet, that is, cold and moiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although the diet preſcribed to young men ought to be like the diet of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in relation to the qualities, yet as to the ſubſtance it muſt be different; whereas the moiſt nouriſhment preſcribed to children ought actually and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially to be that is liquid for the moſt part, or ſuch as may be ſupped, or at leaſt to be ſoft and of eaſie digeſtion. But young men require meats more ſolid, and hard to be concocted, as ſalads, fruits, and the like, which may be digeſted by their ſtronger ſtomachs. Wine is very hurtful for them, eſpecially if it be pure; for as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, it renders them furious; and it precipitates them to wrath and luſt, according to the opinion of <hi>Galen. Old men require a hot and moiſt diet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their bodies are cold and dry.</hi> Among thoſe things which are hot and moiſt wine is very agreeable to old men, and is therefore called <hi>old mens milke,</hi> for it cheriſhes their weak heat, repairs their ſtrength, and concocts the crudities wherewith they do abound, conſumes &amp; dryes up the excrementitious moiſtures, &amp; evacuates them by urine, it expells ſadneſs and induces mirth; and therefore it is elegantly ſaid by <hi>Plato in his</hi> 2. <hi>de Leg.</hi> that <hi>God gave wine to men as a healthful remedy againſt the auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of old age, that they might ſeem to wax young again, and forget ſadneſs, making the hard conſtitution of man tender, as iron put into fire grows more tractable and ſoft. Yet beware</hi> to take too great a quantity thereof, for ſo it will conſume the natural moiſture, and beget catarrhs. That wine is to be choſen which is ſtrong, thin, fragrant, of a good ſavour, midling age, and yellowiſh colour. Thick wines are naught for old men for they cauſe obſtructions, bind the belly, and do not provoke urine, like the former. Hydromel is alſo profitable for old men to the prolonging of life, as <hi>Pliny</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>l.</hi> 22. <hi>Hiſt. Nat. c.</hi> 24. of <hi>Pollio</hi> a Roman, who lived above a hundred years, and being aſked by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by what means he had preſerved that vigour of mind and body, he made this ſhort anſwer, within by wine, ſaid he, and hony, without by oyle. Raw hony (ſo it be very good as that of <hi>Nacor)</hi> is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for old men, eaten with bread at breakfaſt or ſupper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The quantity of meat ought to be leſs for old men then for any other age.</hi> For the heat of old men is weak, not being able to concoct much meat. This <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches <hi>Aph.</hi> 14 <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>In old men there is little natural heat, and therefore they require ſomething to cheriſh it, for it is extinguiſhed by many things. For as Galen ſaith in com.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:153522:136"/>though the flame of the lamp be nouriſhed by oyl, yet if a man ſhould poure too much, it would be extinguiſhed by its own nouriſhment: ſo in old men the natural heat hath ſome things that nouriſh it, yet if it be clogged with too many of thoſe things, it is in danger to be extinguiſhed; as if a man ſhould heap a great pile of wood upon a little ſpark of fire.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the drink ought to be more ſparing, becauſe then the body abounds moſt with humors, and it ought to be the ſtronger, to correct the inconveniences that proceed by the coldneſs of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>

Nevertheleſs it is to be noted that the beginning of the ſpring retains ſomething of the nature of the winter; but ſtill as the ſpring goes forward, the diet is to be changed, that it may come to be more cold, moiſt, and leſs in quantity, which is moſt convenient for the approching ſummer.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The heat which the ſummer brings upon our bodies is to be corrected with coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and moiſtening diet.

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THat Bread which is moſt convenient for nouriſhment and for the health of the body, is to be made of the pureſt meal of wheat, leaven'd, well bak'd, and full of eyes, moderately ſeaſon'd, but new, though more, ſo ſtale as twenty four hours will make it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we have ſet down the general rules concerning the uſe of meats, now we ſhall ſet down ſome more particular and more neceſſary obſervations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thoſe meats which are more principally in uſe; omitting the reſt which would make the work tedious, and may as well be found in thoſe Authors who have writ particularly of the faculties of meats.</p>
                  <p>Beginning therefore with Bread, which is the firſt foundation of nouriſhment, we ſay that it ought to be made of the pureſt wheat-meal. For of all grain which is fit for Bread, wheat is moſt to be valued: of which there are many ſorts, but that ſort which is beſt for Bread is well known to every Countrey, and even among the vulgar. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> upon <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> gives theſe Characters of the beſt Wheat, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhould be hard to break, thick, heavie, of the colour of gold, clear and ſmooth, of three moneths age, ripe, clean, and that grew in a fat ſoyle.</p>
                  <p>Of the pure meal of ſuch wheat Bread is to be made, cleanſed from all branny matter, and is called the flour of meal.</p>
                  <p>This bread is that which nouriſhes moſt of any other, though that which hath bran mix'd among it, looſens the belly more, by reaſon that the bran hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive faculty; And for that cauſe, ſome who are much bound, do mix bran with the meal to keep the belly more ſoluble: Others add a little Rice, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is more moiſt, keeps the belly more laxative.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Bread ought to be leaven'd, becauſe by that the viſcous and tough paſte is attenuated, and (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith in <hi>Timeus)</hi> altered into an airy ſubſtance, and makes it ſwell to a greater bigneſſe, whereby the Bread becomes light and full of eyes, which are other properties of good Bread. But that Bread which wants lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or hath not enough, is hard of digeſtion, oppreſſes the ſtomach, and begets terrible obſtructions. Neither is the opinion of <hi>Celſus</hi> any hinderance to this, who ſaith <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 28. that leaven'd bread is moſt liable to corruption, but that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven'd bread is leaſt ſubject to putrefie in the body, for that opinion is rejected by <hi>Ronſeus, Bruyerinus, Merculius,</hi> and <hi>Silvaticus,</hi> as falſe and erroneous. Yet it may be excus'd, if we add one word to the ſentence, ſaying that Bread too much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd, eaſily corrupts the body, but not that which is not overmuch leaven'd. Though perhaps that was not the intention of the Author. And indeed I know not how he can be excus'd, when as in the ſame Chapter he reckons honey among thoſe things which are eaſily corrupted, when as honey is incorruptible, and being mingled with thoſe things which are corruptible, keeps them from corruption; as in horary fruits, which being preſerved with honey, cannot putrefie. Therefore <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> a Critical Judge of Authors, who alſo hath ſet forth an elegant cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Books of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> boldly paſſes his judgement upon <hi>Cornelius Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:153522:137"/>ſaying that he was no Phyſician; I ſhall repeat his own words, <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. med. conſil.</hi> 10. written to <hi>Bernardinus Caſtellanus,</hi> where he ſaith thus, <hi>That place of</hi> Celſus <hi>concerning unleaven'd Bread, was alwaies by me ſuſpected, whom we may conjecture to have been no Phyſician, by that which</hi> Plinie <hi>a later writer hath left written,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>that there was no Roman untill his times, that practiſed the art of Phyſick: and for that cauſe they committed many errors in things that concern'd the practiſe of the Art: for experience teacheth, that leaven rightly uſed, makes the Bread lighter, and therefore of more eaſie digeſtion, and leſſe troubleſome to the ſtomack; and if there were nothing elſe to confirm it, yet the general cuſtome and conſent of all Nations were enough to ſhew that leavened Bread, for healths ſake, is much better then that which is unleavened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bread ought alſo to be well bak'd; for if it be ill bak'd, it oppreſſes the ſtomack, and is of hard digeſtion, which <hi>Avicen</hi> teaches, <hi>Canon.</hi> 2. <hi>Tract.</hi> 2. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ill-bak'd Bread nouriſhes much, but if any private and ſedentary perſon uſe it, he will be preſently troubled with obſtructions.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be ſeaſoned with a little ſalt, for ſalt like leaven attenuates the thick and ſlimy ſubſtance thereof, and makes it leſſe liable to beget obſtructions. Yet the quantity thereof ought to be moderate, for if the Bread be too ſalt, it dries overmuch.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be new and not above 24. hours old, for ſtale Bread is hard and dry, and of a hard digeſtion, oppreſſes the ſtomach, and bindes the body: but that which is too new and newly drawn out of the oven, retains a clammineſſe, ſo that it ſwels and obſtructs the bowels. Beſides, if it be hot from the oven, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a fiery heat, which troubles the ſpirits and hurts the natural heat, as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus Villanova</hi> writes in his book of thoſe things which prolong youth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The crum is more fit for nouriſhment, for the cruſt dries too much, and begets aduſt and melancholy humors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule is confirmed by the common verſe of the <hi>Salern</hi> School.</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Beware how thou eateſt cruſt,</l>
                        <l>For it produces choler aduſt.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding they who have moiſt ſtomacks may uſe it, ſo that it be not burnt. Chiefly after meals, it is profitable to all men, for it bindes up the mouth of the ſtomack, and helps concoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All fulneſſe is evill, but eſpecially of Bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although Bread nouriſhes more then any other thing, yet if it be eaten in too a great quantity, it brings great harm to the body: for it hath a clammy ſubſtance, which is the reaſon that it nouriſhes ſo much, and therefore if it be taken in too great a quantity, it cannot be well concocted, and conſequently not well attenuated in the ſtomack, ſo that it ſticks in the veins of the Meſenterion, and is the cauſe of very great obſtructions. Which <hi>Avicen</hi> teaches in <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this purpoſe; the impediment of Bread when the ſtomack does not concoct it, is very great; that of fleſh is not ſo much: for it lies long and burdenſome in the ſtomack, and not being ſufficiently concocted, fals down and obſtructs the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and meſaraick veins. But Fleſh hath a greater likeneſſe to the body of man, ſo that it is the leſſe dangerous, and the obſtruction not ſo great, which it cauſes, and ſooner recoverable; the members more quickly drinking in the juice of the fleſh, then that of the bread, by reaſon of the near reſemblance between them.</p>

                     <hi>There are alſo made Barly Broths of peel'd Barly, boyled in water, adding thereto bruiſed Almonds and Sugar.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Barly Broths are good for hot and dry conſtitutions, refreſhing lean people and ſuch as are troubled with the Conſumption, tempering the acrimony of the humors, and refreſhing and fatning the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſet down things that are only proper for people in health, for things proper for the ſick belong not to this place, and therefore we refer the Ptiſan of the Antients to the Diet of ſick perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rice is temperate in the firſt qualities, a little inclining to hot and dry, it nouriſhes much boyled with milk and porrage, though it be harder of digeſtion, and affords a thicker nouriſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it agrees beſt with young men and ſuch as labour; and the frequent uſe thereof by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the ſubſtance begets obſtructions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the thickning, and binding faculty which it hath; it is very good for ſuch as are ſubject to bloudy Flixes, Lasks, Dyſenteries, and other affections procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a defluxion of thin humours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oats ſerve not only for provender for horſes, but alſo for meat for men. For there is made a drink of peel'd Oats boyled in water, adding thereto a little Sugar, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond milk, which is lighter then Barly-water, and therefore more eaſily concocted; it moves urine, becauſe of the thinneſſe of the ſubſtance, as alſo by reaſon of its temper, which inclines to heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beans are us'd either dry, and that by the vulgar ſort, and people of mean degree, or green, which is accounted among the more delicate diſhes, or boyl'd in pottage, or fry'd in a pan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>However they are prepared, they are of ill digeſtion, and hardly diſtributed; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thick and flatulent humours, they ſwell up the belly, and beget a difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and withall binde the belly: they obſtruct the Liver, Spleen and Meſeraick Veins; they ſend many vapours to the head, ſo that they hurt the eyes, and cauſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent dreams, being of a cold and dry temper; yet the green are moiſteſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although Beans are reckoned among the worſt ſorts of nouriſhment, yet they afford excellent medicines; which although it be not our intention here to reckon up, where we only diſcourſe of the matter of nouriſhment, yet we ſhall here contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the method of our Theorems, briefly touch upon them, as being moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and which we have known by certain and daily experience.</p>
                  <p>And firſt there is a water drawn from the new ſhales of Beans moſt profitable for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:153522:138"/>ſuch as are troubled with the Stone; for it cleanſes the reins, and hinders the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſtone, if the patient drink thereof in a morning, at ſeveral times two or three ounces thereof. It is very profitable for ſuch are troubled with a hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the veins, becauſe it is cold and moiſt; when as all other nephretick medicines are extremely heating.</p>
                  <p>Of the dry'd ſhels of Beans, and the ſtalks burnt are made a ſort of Aſhes, which being boyl'd in water of Pellitory of the wall to a kinde of lye, and taken for ſome mornings to the quantity of five or ſix ounces, with an ounce of ſyrup of Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, like a julep, cures efficaciouſly all contumacious and ſtubborn Gonorrhoea's. The ſame is moſt excellent againſt the ſtone hanging in the ureters, cauſing there ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great pains; for it removes it preſently. The ſame effect is performed by a ſalt drawn from the ſaid aſhes, and given to the weight of a dram in water of Pellitory of the wall.</p>
                  <p>Outwardly alſo Bean-meal is applyed with very great ſucceſſe in many affections, eſpecially in inflamations of the teſticles, which often proceed from an ill cured Gonorrhoea. Moſt Chirurgeons, who are oftner conſulted by ignorant patients in venereal diſeaſes then the Phyſicians, obſerving an extraordinary hardneſſe of the inflamed teſticles, preſently apply mollifying Cataplaſms, which increaſe the inflamation, when as that ſoft and ſpongy part, by theſe diſſolving Plaiſters are made more fit to receive the flux of the matter. Therefore thoſe tumors are to be cured with aſtringent and diſcuſſing medicines, to which purpoſe a Cataplaſm made of Bean-meal, boyl'd in Oxycratum, extraordinarily conduces. This plaiſter is to be often changed and renewed, becauſe it ſuddenly dries up, by reaſon of the want of fat ingredients which are mingled in all other Cataplaſms. Though they are not here convenient, becauſe they inflame the part. Yet there may be added to this Cataplaſm, that the ſudden drying thereof may be hindred, a little ſimple Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, which hath a faculty both to diſcuſſe and binde.</p>
                  <p>Peaſe are to be preferred before all other pulſe, being in the middle between things of good, and bad juice, things eaſie to digeſt, and hard to concoct, as <hi>Gal.</hi> teſtifies 1 <hi>de Alim. facult. cap.</hi> 21. and endued with no exceſſive quality, and ſo coming near to a middle temper. Yet cold and dry is a little predominant: they are prepared divers waies, both green and dry.</p>
                  <p>They are more eaſily concocted being ſhal'd, and ſtrained after they are boyl'd; for the ſhales are of hard digeſtion, evil juice and aſtringent. The dry are preferred before the green, being leſſe windy, and of eaſieſt digeſtion; but either of them, as as all other Pulſe, are hurtful to melancholick perſons, and ſuch as abound with thick humours and obſtructions.</p>
                  <p>Chiches have a thicker ſubſtance then Peaſe, and are of a harder concoction, both within the without the body; for they aske longer time of boyling ere they grow ſoft, neither doth any water boyle them ſo tender, as rain or the pureſt and thinneſt fountain water.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe there is made of them an excellent Broth which hath a cleanſing opening faculty, and which provokes both urine and the flowers, for which uſes the blackeſt are moſt commended, which are therefore called medicines amongſt the vulgar.</p>

                     <hi>Our Countrey women make a kinde of Broth to provoke the flowres, of black Chiches, roots of Petroſeline and Saffron, which they give for three daies together, the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being begun, or near beginning.</hi>

                     <hi>LEttice, as</hi> Galen <hi>ſaith, begets the beſt bloud of all Pot-herbs, but little, being cold and moiſt, it provokes ſleep, increaſes milk, looſens the belly, cools the heat of the ſtomack, repreſſes the acrimony of all the humours, it agrees beſt with cholerick, ſanguin and young people, eſpecially in the ſummer. It is eaten raw in Salads; as alſo boyled in broth, it agrees beſt with thoſe who have a weak ſtomack. The often uſe thereof weakens the ſight, as</hi> Dioſcorides <hi>ſaith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many relate that the juice of Lettice drunk to the weight of three or four ounces, kils like other poyſons. Yet ſhould ſo much Lettice be eaten as would yeeld the ſame quantity of juice, it would do no hurt. The reaſon of which is twofold, the firſt is becauſe that whole Lettice remains longer in the ſtomack, ſo that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is corrected by the long concoction thereof, but the juice quickly pierceth to the vitals, the ſecond is becauſe that Lettice is amended by the mixture of ſalt, oyle, and vinegar, and ſometimes ſugar alſo.</p>
                  <p>Colewort, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith 3. <hi>ſimpl. cap.</hi> 15. hath a double ſubſtance, juicy and earthy; the one hot in the firſt degree, and nitrous, the ſecond, cold and dry. The nitrous juice is ſharp and abſterſive, and therefore moves the belly; but the body of it is thick, dry, earthy, aſtringent, and for that cauſe bindes the belly. The thinner part of the juice is drawn out by the firſt boyling of the Cabbage, and therefore that firſt broth moves the belly, the third and ſecond doth not ſo. Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage gives little nouriſhment, and breeds not good humours like Lettice, but rank and vitious.</p>
                  <p>The ill juice thereof is ſeen firſt by the decoction thereof, which ſmels rank, eſpecially that which hath the heads cut off. Beſides, Cabbage putrifying in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens yeelds a moſt noiſome ſmell.</p>
                  <p>Cabbage eaten before other meats, drives away drunkenneſſe; and taken after meat, repels the violent vapours of wine.</p>
                  <p>This vertue of Cabbage to expell drunkenneſſe, proceeds from the antipathy which is between that and the Vine. For Vines will not grow in the ſame ſoyle with Cabbage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it is of hard concoction, and breeds thick and melancholy humours. It exhales much, and by ſending up thick vapours to the brain, it diſquiets the minde and diſturbs the ſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It hath a certain agreement with the Lungs, and therefore the uſe thereof is the leſſe troubleſome to thoſe who are troubled with diſeaſes in the Lungs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But red Cabbage is reckoned among the herbs fit for wounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Cabbage is good for the diſeaſes of the Lungs, the medicines do manifeſt which are made of them. The <hi>Pharmacopaea</hi>'s do commend a looch made of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:153522:139"/>ſtalks. We have ſeen admirable effects thereof in Aſthma's and other diſeaſes of the Lungs made with the juice of red ſtalks reduc'd into the form of a Julep with Sugar. Old Ulcers are healed by a fomentation of the water of Catapults, and afterwards by applying a leaf of red Cabbage moiſten'd in the ſaid water. Water of Catapults is made of the roots of Birthwort, Gentian, Radiſhes, and Wormſeed, of each one ounce, boyled in three pintes of White-wine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of half: afterwards diſſolving in it four ounces of Sugar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beets come neer the nature of Cabbage: for the juice thereof is ended with a ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous quality, absterſive and ſomething ſharp, which cauſes it to looſen the belly, ſo that it inclines to a hot and dry temper. But the earthy part thereof is cold and dry, and binding.</hi>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:153522:140"/>do not remain in the ſame place, but are diſperſed through the body, and becauſe they are mixed with many and ſeveral meats, which is the chief reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onions are hot and dry in the fourth degree, for they are ſharp and biting, yet there is ſome difference according to the more or the leſſe of their chief qualities, as we have ſaid of Radiſhes; and among theſe differences, the long one is more ſharp then the round one, the red then the white, the dry then the green, the raw then the boyled; they afford little and bad nouriſhment, they breed flatulous ſpirits, and with long uſe, pain in the head; they cauſe troubleſome dreams, they hurt the eyes and the gums by reaſon of their ſharpneſſe; they cut, attenuate, open, and move urine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Onion give bad nouriſhment, yet is it an excellent medicine, and conduces much to the cure of many diſeaſes. And firſt, Onions roſted in the cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders eaten with butter, are good for thoſe that are troubled with coughs and Aſthma's. This they do being boyled in brothers. Being dipt in vinegar and eaten in a morning, they prevail againſt the ſtone. The water thereof diſtilled in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Bath; which ſugar'd, doth miracles in the ſame affections. If they be cut into round pellets and ſteeped in water all night, the water given to children, kils the worms. Outwardly applyed, they provoke urine. For this purpoſe there is a cake made of ſlic'd Onions fryed in a pan with eggs, to be applyed to the hairy parts to provoke the ſtop'd urine. Or elſe the little skins are put into a little bag and boyled in Wine, and applyed to the ſame part. They will be more effectual, if the place be firſt anointed with oyl of Scorpions.</p>
                  <p>Onions made hollow and fill'd with bitter Almonds, and roſted in the cinders, and then preſſed, give ſuch a liquor as provokes the flux of the Haemorrhoids, if the ſeat be anointed therewith.</p>
                  <p>They being roſted in the cinders and bruiſed in a marble mortar with a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den peſtle, adding an equall proportion of new butter, aſſwage the pain of the Haemorrhoids, and ſoften and diſcuſſe the ſwelling tumors of thoſe parts.</p>

                     <hi>Leeks are of the ſame nature, temper and faculties with Onions; but weaker. By</hi> Hipp. <hi>they are commended to be good to help conception, not only taken inwardly, but alſo outwardly applyed by fomentations and Cataplaſms.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Apricocks are much of the ſame temper with Peaches, but leſſe moiſt, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in goodneſſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſes, neither ſo ſuddenly growing ſowre nor putrefying ſo ſoon. But they are ſweeter and more grateful to the ſtomack, which for that reaſon doth more ſuddenly concoct them.</p>
                  <p>Cherries are much of the nature of Damſens, both in reſpect of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and vertues, yet there is no ſmall difference as to their ſeveral kindes: thoſe which are ſowre are colder, and leſſe ſubject to putrefaction, the ſweet ones more corruptible.</p>
                  <p>Green Figs, in their active qualities are temperate, in their paſſive moiſt: they breed juice good enough, if they be fully ripe. But if they be not fully ripe (which is known by their ſending milk out of the ſtalk when they are gathered) then they breed an evill and corroſive juice, whence ariſe putrid Feavers and Dyſenteries; they eaſily deſcend into the belly, and taken before meat they looſen the belly and cleanſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dry Figs are hot in the firſt degree, endued with an attenuating and absterſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; they corroborate the body, looſen the belly, cleanſe the reins, help the cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the lungs, and open the obſtructions of the liver and ſpleen; being eaten in too great a quantity they provoke thirſt, becauſe they are hot; they breed impure bloud, and ſubject to putrefaction; ſo that the often eating of them produceth lice and ſcabs.</hi>

                  <p>Some authors report that they reſiſt poyſon, and <hi>Plinie</hi> declares that <hi>Mithridates</hi> carried alwaies about him an Antidote which was made of Figs,

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Fleſh of Animals is very different, not only as to the ſeveral kindes, but alſo as to the ſame ſpecies, in reference to the age, countrey, food, habit, gelding, ſex, and preparation.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of young living creatures, eſpecially of thoſe newly born, is ſlimy, ſoft, moiſt, and excrementitious, eſpecially where they are moſt moiſt by nature; yet it is ſooner concocted, and makes the belly ſoluble.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of thoſe that are old is hard, dry, nervous, hard of digeſtion, giving little and bad nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>But the Fleſh of thoſe that are of a midling age, is of a midling conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which feed in moiſt and mooriſh places, have moiſt fleſh, and full of ſuperfluities; but they that feed on dry places and mountains, are void of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, more eaſie of digeſtion, and apter to nouriſh.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of wilde beaſts is leſſe excrementitious and dryer then that of tame ones, whoſe fleſh is more moiſt and excrementitious.</p>
                  <p>Lean and extenuated Fleſh is hard and dry, hard of digeſtion, and giving little nouriſhment; but thoſe which are fat and full of greaſe, and over moiſt, hurtful to the ſtomack, breeding nauſeateneſſe, if the fat be exceſſive. But if it be neither too lean nor too fat, for goodneſſe of ſubſtance and ſweetneſſe of taſte, it is to be preferred above the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe creatures which feed in places where there are good paſtures, are ſweeter and more nouriſhing. So the Sheep which in our thickets feed upon thyme, lavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, roſemary, and other aromatical plants, have much ſweeter fleſh then thoſe that feed in mountains, where thoſe plants are not. So mountain Partridges are leſſe ſweet then thoſe that feed in the low woods.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of gelt beaſts is more tender, ſweet and of an eaſier digeſtion: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Wethers, Oxen, Barrow-hogs, and Capons.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of the male is to be preferred before the fleſh of the female, becauſe the males are hotter and dryer, and more laborious, and leſſe burden'd with excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as appears in Oxen and Wethers.</p>
                  <p>Boyl'd Fleſh is moiſter and ſooner deſcends.</p>
                  <p>Roſted Fleſh the dryer, becauſe the fat and moiſture is conſumed by the fire; fry'd it is more dry, and acrimonious; being ſeaſoned with ſalt and ſpices, they are yet hotter and dryer.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Fleſh roſted and boyled, there is a doubt moved by <hi>Ariſtotle, Prob.</hi> 54. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. where he affirms, that roſted. Fleſh is moiſter then boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Which ſeems repugnant both to ſenſe it ſelf, and to the Theoreme ſet down. Yet the queſtion is reſolved by ſaying, that roſted Fleſh hath more of its own proper and naturall moiſture, but boyl'd hath more adventitious, which is ſuckt in while it lies in the water; being dryer, by reaſon that their proper moiſture goes out all into the broth: which is the reaſon that they nouriſh leſſe then roſted meats, if they be eaten apart and without their liquor.</p>
                  <p>Boyled Fleſh is beſt for thoſe who are yet growing, and therefore of a hot
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:153522:142"/>temper, as alſo to thoſe who are ſick of hot and dry diſeaſes; and that chiefly in hot and dry Countreys and ſeaſons of the year. But roſted meats are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for thoſe who are of a cold and moiſt temper, who are looſe, and ſubject to cold and moiſt diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>THE Fleſh of Wethers in our Countrey is the beſt and moſt in uſe, and moſt convenient for every age, complexion, and time. 'Tis temperate or at leaſt moderately hot and moiſt. That is beſt either to roſt or boyle, which is of Wethers of one or two years old, nouriſhed in pure air and good paſture.</p>
                  <p>Fleſh of Ewes is of an evil juice, excrementitious, hard of digeſtion, by reaſon of its ſlimy and clammy ſubſtance, and frequent breeding.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Lambs is moiſt, flegmatick, and mucous, and for that cauſe not to be uſed in the judgement of <hi>Galen, l. de vict. atten. c.</hi> 8. which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Lambs newly dropt from the Ewe; not of thoſe which are grown, for they give good nouriſhment, and are of eaſie digeſtion. Hence the fleſh of them is moſt convenient for thoſe which are of a tender and delicate conſtitution, and who exerciſe little. Beſides there is a difference in the Countreys where they grow, For at <hi>Paris</hi> Lamb is much valued, with us Kids fleſh is preferred before it.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Kids is moiſter then that of Lambs, and therefore to be preferred eſpecially with us; it nouriſhes moderately, generates a thin and moiſt bloud, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens the belly, and is better roſted then boyled.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Oxen is hot and moiſt, being abſolutely conſidered, becauſe all fleſh is of that temper, as being made of hot and moiſt bloud. Comparatively though in reſpect of other creatures, it is hard and dry, of hard digeſtion and bindes the belly; it generates a dryer and melancholy bloud, it affords a firm nouriſhment if it be well concocted, and therefore profitable for ſtrong bodies and thoſe that uſe much exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>Veal in its active qualities is temperate, in the paſſive moiſt, of a good juice, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie concoction, and fit for both healthy and ſick people. But it is more convenient for thoſe that live ſoft and ſedentary lives, and for ſuch as are of a tender conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, then to Porters, Mariners, or Ditchers, and others who undergoe hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for whom Beef is more convenient.</p>
                  <p>Hogs fleſh in the active qualities is temperate, in the paſſive moiſt: <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it to be moſt like the fleſh of men, and that it nouriſhes above all meats; it hath a thick and clammy juice, and therefore affords a firm and durable nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is not eaſily diſſipated.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Pigs is very moiſt, mucous and flegmatick, more excrementitious then the former, and moiſter; ſo that it nouriſhes leſſe. The nouriſhment which it gives is eaſily diſtributed by reaſon of the thinneſſe of the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Hares is dry, hard, and thick, the parent of melancholy bloud, which is to be underſtood of the old ones; for the fleſh of Leverets is very delicate, and equally eſteemed with Partridge for daintineſs: thoſe to be preferred which are not above 2, 3, or 4 moneths old.</p>
                  <p>Rabbets come next the nature of Hares, though here the difference lies between
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:153522:143"/>them, that Rabbets are beſt which are of midling age. The older are dry and hard, thoſe which are too young, call'd ſucking Rabbets are overmoiſt and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious. The wilde ones are preferred before thoſe which are tame, as being leſſe moiſt and excrementitious. The tame ones which are brought up at home, are fatter indeed, and more fleſhy, but much inferior in taſte and wholſomeneſſe to the wilde ones; they taſte of the paſture where they feed; and therefore if they eat Cabbage, as ſometimes they do, they taſte abominably. If they eat wheat, they grow very fat, and afford a delicate nouriſhment. The wilde ones which in our thickets are fed with Thyme, Lavender, Origan, and other aromatical herbs, afford a pleaſant and wholſome nouriſhment.</p>

                  <p>THe ſubſtance of the Liver conſidered in the generation thereof, affords a thick nouriſhment, and of hard digeſtion and fit to increaſe obſtructions. Yet there is great difference in reſpect of the ſeveral ſorts of creatures, from whence they are taken. For the Livers of Hens, Capons, Geeſe, Chickens, and Pullets, are excellently good. But concerning the Livers of four footed Beaſts, thoſe of Kids, Calves, and Hogs, yeeld an indifferent good nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>The Spleen produces a melancholy juice, and affords a very depraved nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which is hard to be concocted and diſtributed. The Reins are of a hard concoction by reaſon of the ſolidity of the ſubſtance, wherewith they are endued; they breed a thick juice and evill, by reaſon of the various and excrementitious humours which continually oppreſs them.</p>
                  <p>The Heart hath a kinde of fibrous fleſh, ſolid and hard, and therefore is of a hard digeſtion, ſlowly diſtributed, and generating an evill juice; yet if it be well concocted, it affords not a little nouriſhment, and that not evil.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs are of an eaſier digeſtion then the Liver and Spleen, becauſe they are ſofter and looſer, yet not inferior to the Liver, as to nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>All Kernels have this common among them, that in meat they appear ſweet, tender, and ſhort; they give a thick nouriſhment; and if the beaſt be ſound, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and being well concocted in the ſtomack, they nouriſh as much as muſculous fleſh. Not well digeſted, they breed flegmatick and raw juice; this is chiefly to be underſtood of the Kernels of the breſt; for of other Kernels, thoſe which are ſoft generate flegmy bloud, but thoſe which are hard, raw bloud.</p>
                  <p>The tongue of Calves, Kids, Lambs, Hogs, and Sheep are of eaſie digeſtion, and breed laudable juice. Neats Tongue is thicker, but more fit for nouriſhment, and not dry'd.</p>
                  <p>The Brains afford a flegmatick diet, of a thick juice, hard to be concocted, ſlowly deſcending, it banes the appetite, and cauſeth nauſeouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fat and Greaſe are of little nouriſhment, and rather ſawce for our meat then nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. They looſen the tunicles of the ſtomack, and ſpoil the retention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and therefore they breed nauſeouſneſſe, and dull the appetite. In cholerick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they turn into choler, and are of hard digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the Stomack is filmy, and therefore cold, hard, dry, and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. It is of a hard digeſtion, generates flegm, begets obſtructions, and is the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:153522:143"/>cauſe of many diſeaſes. Soft and Sedentary men muſt abſtain from it; it being only fit for Potters, Ploughmen, and Mariners.</p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſon ſerves for the Guts, becauſe they are of like nature; but the Guts of younger creatures, as of Lambs and Kids, are of an eaſier ſubſtance and concoction.</p>
                  <p>The Feet and other extreme parts of four-footed Beaſts conſiſting of membranes, ligaments, nerves, veins, arteries and griſtles, are cold and dry, clammy, viſcous; of little nouriſhment, and hard digeſtion. We except the extreme parts of young and ſucking Animals, as before where we ſpake of the Stomack and Guts.</p>

                     <hi>THE Bloud is hot and moiſt, hard of digeſtion, and breeds many excrements.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Marrow is hot and moiſt, it gives good nouriſhment, if it be well concocted; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too great a quantity, it looſens the ſtomack, and begets a nauſeouſneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Milk in the active qualities is temperate, inclining to cold; in the paſſive, moiſt; by reaſon of the fat and watry ſubſtance, thickning through its</hi> caſeous <hi>or cheeſie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and absterſive in reſpect of its</hi> ſerous <hi>quality; aſſwaging in reſpect of its</hi> butyrous <hi>quality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is beſt, which is white, clear, pure and ſincere, ſweet, voy'd of all acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſowreneſſe, bitterneſſe, and ſaltneſſe, rendring a ſweet, but little ſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For its ſubstance moderate, neither over thick or caſeous, nor over thin and ſerous, not fluid, but ſticking to the nail, if it be dropt thereon new, and milked from one that is well fed and in good paſture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Milk thus qualified is of all nouriſhments the beſt, it is eaſily concocted and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned into bloud; it nouriſhes ſufficiently, and fattens, but it ſwels the ſtomach and guts. But for all this, it muſt be uſed only by thoſe whoſe bodies are in health and free from ſuperfluities. In cold ſtomacks it turns ſowre, in cholerick at begets aduſt ſmell. But bad Milk is moſt pernicious, and is ſo far from breeding good juice, that it breeds very bad humours in the bodies of thoſe that uſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bad effects of vitious Milk <hi>Galen</hi> ſhewes in <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Alim. fac. c.</hi> 15. by the example of nurſes, who in times of famine uſed wilde herbs, and their children ſucking their Milk, became full of ulcers and other diſeaſes. As alſo by the example of Goats fed with Scammony and Tithymal, whoſe Milk purges.</p>
                  <p>Of all the ſorts of Milk fit for the diet of healthy people, Cowes Milk is the thickeſt and fatteſt; for it hath moſt of the caſeous ſubſtance, and leaſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. So that it looſens the belly leſſe, and nouriſhes more. It is more difficultly concocted, more ſlowly curdled, ſlower to deſcend, and more hard to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and more liable to breed obſtructions. Goats Milk is of a midling ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as alſo Ewes Milk, which is thicker then that of Goats, for it hath more of cheeſe and leſſe whey; and therefore looſens leſſe, and bindes the more. Aſſes Milk is thinneſt, and moſt wheyie. But that concerns the cure more then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of health.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:153522:144"/>
                  <p>Butter is hot and moiſt in the firſt degree, and almoſt of the ſame nature as oyl of ripe Olives, as <hi>Avicen</hi> witneſſeth. But is more moiſt, then hot; ſtale But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is hotter and thinner; new, almoſt temperate in the active qualities. It nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, looſens, fattens, and is good againſt the cough. The too much uſe of it looſens the retention of the ſtomack, takes away the appetite, and begets a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſſe; and therefore to be avoided by thoſe who are ſubject to looſneſſe, as alſo by men of hot complexions, who burn it and turn it into choler; it is to be eaten firſt, for it ſpeedily deſcends into the paunch and makes way for the other meat; but if it be eaten laſt, it looſens the ſtomack, and hinders the orifice from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the meat and cloſing up.</p>
                  <p>Cream of milk is like butter, and agrees with it in vertues and qualities: they differ in this, that Butter is made by art, and Cream ſwims up of its own accord.</p>
                  <p>Cowes milk abounds chiefly with it, by reaſon it hath much fat; it looſens the ſtomack, ſwims above the meat, and throwes down the nouriſhment afore it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, ſends vapours to the head, and begets a thick juice.</p>
                  <p>Beeing boyl'd it hath a ſubſtance like new Cheeſe, and breeds thick juice, the wheyie part being extracted by the fire, it hurts the ſtomack leſſe then new preſs'd cheeſe: it is good againſt hot defluxions, allayes thirſt, provokes ſleep; but it is hurtfull to a cold ſtomack and diſeaſes of the nerves. Being old and hardened, it is of a hard digeſtion; it breeds thirſt, nouriſhes little, it bindes the belly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets wind.</p>
                  <p>All Cheeſe hath not the ſame nature and temper, but according to the variety of the creatures from which it is taken, and according to the age, ſmell, taſte, and other circumſtances thereof.</p>
                  <p>Cheeſe from Cows, nouriſhes more, but is hard of concoction, Cheeſe of Ews milk hath a thicker ſubſtance, but is more eaſily concocted, it nouriſheth leſſe, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a better nouriſhment then the former. Cheeſe of Goats milk is worſe, and more hardly concocted by reaſon of its acrimony.</p>
                  <p>Old Cheeſe is hot becauſe of the acrimony, and ſometimes putrefaction which it contracts, through the mixture of ſalt or runnet, when it is made; and by how much the older it is, by ſo much the ſharper it is, and by conſequence hotter and dryer; and as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, hot in the third degree. Hence by reaſon of its heat and drineſſe, it is of hard digeſtion, and apt to increaſe the ſtone, eſpecially if it be too much ſalted. It is therefore to be avoided, becauſe as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, together with <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> it is of a difficult concoction and diſtribution, bindes the belly, and turns into klack choler; but taken in a little quantity after other meats, it helps concoction, though of it ſelf it be of hard digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>While it is New, and ſoft, it is cold and moiſt, more windy then hard and dry, becauſe of the moiſture, but leſſe provoking thirſt, and leſſe binding; it nouriſhes well and breeds fat, uſefull to the ſtomack, it is eaſily diſtributed into the members, being not of ſuch a hard and evil juice, as old Cheeſe; yet it is of hard digeſtion, and cauſes the ſtone and other diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>That which ſtinks is worſt of all, but that which ſmels well, is wholſomer. Being ſharp and ſalt, it is hot and dry, cauſes thirſt, and evil juice: that which is ſowre is of an evil juice, and cold. That which is ſweet and fat, is moderately hot, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes more, and is of a better juice.</p>
                  <p>Fat Cheeſe and full of butter, is better; that which is lean and without butter, is far worſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of nouriſhment from Birds.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE fleſh of Hens in the active qualities is temperate, in the paſſive moiſt, of eaſie digeſtion, of good juice, and full of nouriſhment. <hi>Avicen</hi> writes that it increaſes the wit and underſtanding, that it clears the voice, and increaſes ſeed; all which things are to be underſtood of thoſe which are of a middle age, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fat; for old Hens are condemn'd, as being hard, nervous, lean, and only fit for hatching.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Capons and Cock-pullets, is of the ſame nature and temper with the fleſh of Hens that are young, but with this difference, that thoſe pullets have a thinner ſubſtance and nouriſh leſſe, and therefore not fit for labouring bodies.</p>
                  <p>Young Pigeons are reckoned among the moſt laudable nouriſhments, they are of an eaſie digeſtion, they breed a juice neither thick nor thin, but midling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both.</p>
                  <p>Turkeys do not give place to Capons nor Hens if they be young and kill'd two or three days before: for if they be old and new kill'd, they have a hard fleſh, and more difficult to digeſt.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Geeſe is hot and moiſt, hard of digeſtion, and full of Excrements. And the older they are, ſo much the harder, tougher, and unfit for nouriſhment; obſtructive they are, and full of evil juice; but thoſe which are of a middle age and well fatted, are better and tenderer; and in many places reckoned for dainties.</p>
                  <p>Goſlins are unwholſome, containing a ſlimy and excrementitious nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Of Birds, Partridges are the chiefeſt, without which the moſt ſumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets loſe their grace and ſplendour, their fleſh is very toothſome, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, and hung up a little after they are kill'd; they increaſe good bloud, and that in great plenty, and void of excrements; they increaſe the memory, and multiply ſeed, exciting luſt. And <hi>Cardanus</hi> affirms that the long uſe of Partridge cures the Pox, the whole maſſe of bloud and all the body being renewed by them.</p>
                  <p>Ring-doves, Turtles, Quailes, Thruſhes, Blackbirds, Larks, and other mountain birds obtain the next place to Partridges; they breed excellent juice, nouriſh well, and have very little excrement.</p>
                  <p>About the Quaile there is ſome controverſie. For <hi>Galen, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that thoſe who eat Quails often, are ſubject to cramps, the cauſe of which by <hi>Pliny</hi> is ſaid to be becauſe that Quailes do feed much upon black Hellebore. <hi>Avicen</hi> addeth, that they have an occult quality that cauſes the cramp. Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this opinion, the chief of which party is <hi>Averroes,</hi> affirming that the fleſh of Quailes is moſt wholſome, and that it generates good bloud; which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to reaſon: for there are few countreys in which Hellebore is ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; thoſe Birds feeding moſt upon the beſt herbs and corn. Neither doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach us that thoſe who eat Quailes, are troubled with the Epilepſie. Add to this, that by the benefit of God they were granted to the Iſraelites in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, which would not have been, but that they afforded ſingular good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And although there did ariſe from thence heavie diſeaſes among the iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, yet that proceeded from the abuſe of that meat which they gourmandized, ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:153522:145"/>that they could not ſufficiently concoct it: whence came crudities and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>But this is a general rule concerning the fleſh both of Beaſts and Birds, that they differ much according to their age, place of breeding and manner of dreſſing. When as the fleſh of thoſe that are young and growing, is much better then of thoſe that are old and declining; but as the fleſh of thoſe that are in the prime of their age ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a midling nature: ſo the fleſh of thoſe that are new born, is mucous, moiſt and full of excrement.</p>
                  <p>Roſted and fry'd in a frying pan, it is dryer: boyl'd, it is moyſter; but thoſe creatures that live in moiſt and mooriſh places, have a more moiſt and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious fleſh, and harder of digeſtion; thoſe that feed upon mountains, have dryer fleſh, more eaſily concocted, and void of excrement.</p>
                  <p>There are Egges which come from ſeverall creatures; but Hens Eggs are moſt in uſe: they conſiſt of a twofold ſubſtance, of a different temper; the yolk, and the white; the yolk is moderately hot and moiſt, it affords excellent nouriſhment, it ſympathizes with the bloud, and is therefore ſooneſt turned thereinto. And therefore vulgarly it is ſaid to generate as much bloud as it weighs, ſo void of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement it is. The white is cold and moderately dry, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe are the beſt Eggs, which are white, long and new; for Eggs of one daies laying, are called golden, of two, ſilver; and of three, iron.</p>
                  <p>Rear Eggs, that being moderately boyled in water, tremble in the hand, are fitteſt of all for the nouriſhment of the body, as <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifies, and nouriſh more then Eggs more boyled.</p>
                  <p>Eggs boyled in the ſhell ſo long till they may be ſupt off, nouriſh leſſe then thoſe that tremble by reaſon of the thinneſſe of the ſubſtance: they paſſe eaſily away and and looſen the belly gently.</p>
                  <p>Eaten faſting, they clear the voice, facilitate the birth, allay coughing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the poyſon of the peſtilence. Both thoſe that may be ſupt, and thoſe that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for ſickly people, old folks, infants, and ſuch as are troubled with the Ptiſick, Bleeding, or any other notable evacuation, are very profitable.</p>
                  <p>Eggs harden'd with long boyling, are of hard concoction, they beget a thick juice, and binde the belly. Roſted in the cinders they harden more, and are of a worſe and thicker nouriſhment: they endure a greater force of the fire, and loſe more of their natural moiſture, then hardned by boyling.</p>
                  <p>Fry'd Eggs are worſt of all, they are of a hard concoction, they paſſe ſlowly, they beget a thick and ill juice, and corrupt the humours alſo that are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them; which is to be underſtood of Eggs fry'd to an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardneſſe.</p>
                  <p>There is a kinde of Cheeſe-cake made of Eggs dreſt in a pan, with a good quantity of butter, which is very wholſome: which may be alſo ſaid of Eggs beaten together in a platter, to a moderate thickneſſe with butter-milk, and ſugar added to them afterwards, for they are eaſily concocted, and nouriſh very much.</p>

                  <p>Fiſh that live in filthy, muddy, ſtinking waters, are moſt unwholſome. For thoſe are very much condemned that breed in puddles, lakes, ſmall ſtreams, and muddy; or in rivers defiled with the excrements of Cities.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Fiſh are beſt approved of, that breed in gravelly waters, which are very clear, for they are more eaſily concocted, and they increaſe bloud which is neither too thick, nor too thin.</p>
                  <p>Fiſh that are ſcaly, and have a ſubſtance that crumbles eaſily, are more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then thoſe which have no ſcales. For they have a dryer ſubſtance, but the others a more ſlimy, moiſt, and glutinous matter.</p>
                  <p>Fiſh that live in the deep ſea are better then thoſe which are toſſed up and down by the waves in the ſhallow places, and rendred more dry by the continual beating of the ſea: thoſe that live near the ſhore are moſt impure, becauſe the ſea is there leſſe agitated, and conſequently more muddy and leſſe wholſome.</p>
                  <p>From theſe general rules it will be very eaſie to diſtinguiſh the nature, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe or unwholſomeneſſe of the ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh; that it will be needleſſe to make any further diſcourſe thereof.</p>

                  <p>CInnamon is hot in the third degree, dry in the ſecond. It provokes urine, and the flowres, quickens the ſight, attenuates, cuts, digeſts, and helps concoction, diſſipates winde, corroborates the parts, and bindes gently.</p>
                  <p>Cloves are hot and dry in the third degree: they are appropriated to the brain, heart, ſtomack, and womb. They ſtrengthen the brain, conſume the matter of diſtillations, quicken the underſtanding, ſtrengthen the memory, correct the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the brain, and are profitable againſt diſeaſes which do thence proceed. They comfort the vitall ſpirits, expell the cramp, forward the concoction of the ſtomack, take away nauſeouſneſſe, and diſpell wind; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the womb, and aſſwage the diſtempers thereof; they quicken the ſight, and excite venery.</p>
                  <p>Ginger is hot in the third degree, and moiſt in the firſt, and is preſently rotten by reaſon of its moiſture. It ſtrengthens the ſtomack, diſpels winde, and cures the want of appetite cauſed by cold humours.</p>
                  <p>Pepper is hot and dry in the third degree: the long Pepper is leſſe dry, ſo that it is ſooner rotten. The white is ſharper and hotter then the black; it helps the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the ſtomack, moves the appetite, diſpels wind, is good againſt the cough and affections of the breaſt; it facilitates the birth, and diſpels dimneſſe from the ſight.</p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:153522:146"/>
                  <p>Nutmeg is hot and dry in the ſecond degree; and therefore ſtrengthens the ſtomack; it diſpels wind, ſweetens the breath, ſuppreſſes looſneſſe, helps concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is good in cold affections of the brain, nerves, and womb.</p>
                  <p>Saffron is hot in the ſecond degree and dry in the firſt, it bindes gently, helps concoction, moves urine, excites venery, hath a cordial vertue, reſiſts poyſon and putrefaction, it wonderfully helps thoſe that are troubled with Coughs, Aſthma's Phthiſick, and Pleuriſies; it brings an excellent colour into the face, opening the obſtructions of the Liver, and helping concoction, if it be moderately uſed: it brings down the birth, flowres, and ſecundines. But the too much uſe and ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof hurts the head, for it fils it; it troubles the minde, and attenuates the ſpirits and diſperſeth them, ſo that being taken in too great a quantity it haſtens death.</p>
                  <p>We knew a woman, that to bring down her flowres, uſed ſuch an abundance of Saffron, which caus'd her flowres to come down in ſo great a quantity, as that ſhe dyed in three daies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dodoneus</hi> ſaith, it is ſo extraordinary a medicine in affections of the Lungs, that it hath brought back life to thoſe who have been at the point of death by reaſon of the Phthiſick, being taken to the quantity of a ſcruple or half a ſcruple in ſweet Wine. Being taken alſo in the ſame manner, he ſaith, it takes away the heavy pains that precede a Feaver.</p>
                  <p>Muſtard corrects the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the ſtomack, cleanſes it from flegm, helps concoction, and revives the appetite.</p>
                  <p>Salt is hot in the ſecond degree, dry in the third, it cleanſes, digeſts, bindes, thickens, drives away putrefaction, excites the appetite, helps the concoction of the ſtomack, looſens the belly, and makes moſt meats ſavoury. But us'd in too great a quantity, it begets the Stone, the Itch, Scabs, and Scurfe; it increaſes the Scurvy, as appears by thoſe who feed much on ſalt fiſh and fleſh; it weakens the ſight, diminiſheth the ſeed, and is hurtfull to cholerick and melancholy people.</p>
                  <p>Meats much ſeaſoned with Salt being often uſed, have the ſame ill qualities, and beſides that, they are harder and more difficult to digeſt, becauſe their natural moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is conſumed, which cauſeth their ſubſtance to grow thick and hard, and the leſſe capable of concoction.</p>
                  <p>New and ſweet Oyle preſſed out of ripe Olives, is moderately hot and moiſt, it mollifies, looſens, aſſwages, tempers all acrimony, kills worms, and reſiſts poyſon.</p>
                  <p>Sugar is hot and dry in the firſt degree; it expels putrefaction, cleanſes, and therefore helps the ſtomack, becauſe it carries away the flegm thereof: but if the ſtomack be full of choler it is hurtful, by reaſon that it ſoon turns into choler. It is good for the reins and bladder by cleanſing them from gravel and ſlimy flegm, it cleanſes the breaſt, looſens the belly, nouriſhes very much; but the too often uſe thereof begets obſtructions, as all ſweet things, which the Liver ſpeedily drawes to it ſelf, and with it the other meats before they are concocted; it hurts the teeth, for it blacks and rots them; and therefore after eating thereof, the mouth is to be waſhed.</p>

                     <hi>HOny is hot and dry in the ſecond degree: yet there is ſome difference in reſpect of the places where the Bees gather it. That is hotter and dryer which is made in hotter places, ſtored with Thyme, Lavender, Roſemary, and other Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal herbs: but in cold Countreys where theſe herbs are not, it is leſſe hot. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that which is yellow is hotter then the white. And our ſenſes do tell us, that ſome is more ſweet then others; ſome ſharper, and conſequently of greater force and vertues. It cleanſes, looſens, provokes urine, heals the cough, and reſiſts rottenneſſe. So that horary fruits if they be preſerved in Hony, though there be nothing that rots ſooner, keeps unputrefied for many years. It is good for old folks, and people of moiſt tempers, and in the winter time; hurtful to young cholerick ſtomachs, and in the ſummer. It is good againſt the Stone, Aſthma's, and other affections of the Lungs. It nouriſhes little, it refreſhes the ſtrength of body and minde, recreates the ſenſes, and makes them more acute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We thought good to explain the nature and vertues of Hony in a particular Chapter, both becauſe of the excellency thereof, as alſo becauſe it is not ſo much to be reckoned among ſauces, as meats themſelves. And laſtly, becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> writes, that the nature of Hony is different from that of Plants and Animals.</p>
                  <p>The excellency thereof is confirmed by many authorities and examples. For <hi>Plinie</hi> calleth Hony divine Nectar. And again, in imitation of <hi>Ariſteus,</hi> he ſaith that Hony is none of the meaneſt advantages to humane life. But that it was in very much uſe among the Ancients, and availed much to the preſervation of health, there are many Hiſtories to confirm. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (ſo ſaith <hi>Laertius</hi>) liv'd frugally contented many times with nothing but Hony, and lived to the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year; and he affirmed that thoſe might live without diſeaſes, who uſed much Hony. <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> relates that the diet of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> was bread and Hony. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſan. tuend. c.</hi> 4. relates the ſtory of <hi>Antiochus</hi> a Phyſitian, and <hi>Telephus</hi> a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, of which the firſt was wont to eat every day at the third hour bread and Hony, ſeldome raw, ofteneſt boyl'd, and with other diet ſet down there, he exceeded fourſcore years. The laſt for his breakfaſt eat raw Hony with Rice boyled in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lived above 100. years. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 24. relates of <hi>Pollion,</hi> who exceeded 100 years, that when the Emperor asked him how he did to prolong his daies to that age, anſwered, by uſing Oyl without, and Hony within; which he learnt from <hi>Democritus,</hi> who being asked how a man might live in health, anſwered, If he oyl his outſide, and uſe Hony inwardly.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Democritus</hi> being in his old age weary of his life, endevoured to end his daies by abſtaining from nouriſhment. But at the feaſt of <hi>Ceres,</hi> the women im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning him not to ſadden the houſe at ſuch a time of general mirth, he cauſed a veſſell of Hony to be brought him, and meerly by the vapour thereof ſuſtained his life for ſome daies. <hi>Atheneus</hi> writes, that the <hi>Cyrntans</hi> who inhabited <hi>Corſica,</hi> were therefore long liv'd becauſe they fed much upon Hony, of which there was great plenty in that place. Laſtly, the excellency of Hony is confirmed by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſacred Scripture, where ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, it ſaith, <hi>He ſhall eat Hony and Butter, that he may know to chooſe the good and reject the evil.</hi> For good humours being generated by Hony, and out of good humours good ſpirits, which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:153522:147"/>are the cauſes of all the actions of the body and brain, it follows that the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of increaſes the wit and underſtanding; the operation whereof conſiſts in perfect knowing.</p>
                  <p>The nature of Honey is ſecret enough, it being uncertain under what head and order of things to reduce it: <hi>Galen</hi> having alſo written that the nature thereof is different from all plants and animals: and Authors differ much about this matter, ſome ſaying that it proceeds ſimply and purely from the air, and that it is gathered by the Bees for food, and carried into their hives; other affirming that it is collected by the Bees from the juice of plants. The firſt opinion is held by <hi>Ariſtotle, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and divers others: and experience tels us that in Countreys abounding with Hony in the ſpring time and in the morning, the leaves are to be ſeen all covered with a dew falling down from the air. Therefore Hony is a certain airy and fat dew proceeding from certain fat vapours aſcending from the earth, and condens'd in the air, which is gathered by the Bees from off the flowers and leaves of plants, and reſerved in their hives for food. Yet there remains a doubt, whether any Hony can be generated from the juice of flowers, when as it is without doubt that wax is made by the Bees out of the juice of herbs: which having ſo great a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with Hony, it is not unlikely that Hony is generated out of the ſame juices, when there is no dew: this is moſt certain, that Hony hath a reſemblance with the vertues of thoſe plants out of which it is collected. So that which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from Thyme, ſmels of Thyme; that which is made in <hi>Sardinia</hi> where there is plenty of Wormwood, is bitter: in <hi>Pontus,</hi> it is poyſon, becauſe of the abundance of Rhododendron which growes there. But the vertues of the plants may be eaſily communicated to the Hony, while it lies and ſticks to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Hony is the beſt which is of a yellow colour, ſweet ſavour, having neither the taſte nor ſmell of the flowers, yet pleaſant to the palat. Yet the white Hony, ſuch as is that of</hi> Narbon <hi>and</hi> Attica, <hi>is more excellent for nouriſhment, by reaſon that it is the more temperate; yet the yellow is to be preferred in medicines. But all Hony is the nouriſhment of medicines, becauſe it doth not only perfectly nouriſh, as being moſt perfect and incorruptible and free from excrements, but alſo becauſe it warms the body, cleanſes the ſtomack and guts from the flegm that ſticks to them, and looſens the belly, and affords not a few other benefits to the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hony gathered in the Spring, is better then that gathered in Autumn, as being taken from new wax, and generated from new plants. Summer Hony is worſe then that which is gathered in the Spring, becauſe it is more ſharp and hot.</hi> The winter Hony is worſt of all, for it evaporates from the wax and growes thick.</p>

                     <hi>PVre water is cold and moiſt, that is best which is clear, limpid, without any mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, or matter ſwimming in it, without any taſte or ſmell, thin and ſmooth, which runs ſpeedily through the Hypochondrium, and is preſently diſtributed through the body; ſoon hot and ſoon cold.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:153522:147"/>other, that water is the beſt: when they are both dry weigh them again, and if one be lighter then the other, that water is the beſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the places whence water is taken; fountain water is to be preferred, ſo it have the above named qualities; for if it want them, it is to be rejected.</hi> Hip. li. de loc. Aer. &amp; aq. <hi>ſets down other properties, that it ſhould flow toward the Eaſtern Sun, eſpecially in the ſummer. That it ſhould glide through clean ground, neither muddy nor clayie, but through ſand and gravel; and which is hot in the winter and cold in the ſummer. For that ſhews that it flowes from the deep bowels of the earth, which by Antiperiſtaſis, are hot in the winter and cold in the ſummer. Thoſe that riſe againſt the Northern or Southern Sun are worſe, as being raw, and heavy, and paſsing ſlowly through the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rain water next to fountain water is counted beſt, and by ſome preferred before it, if it have its due properties, which are theſe; that it be brought in earthen pipes into a covered ciſtern; if it paſſe through a gravelly place; if it fall in the ſpring time in gentle ſhowers and not in ſtorms; if it be kept in a very clean ciſtern, and that it waſh down along with it no filth from the tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have given the firſt place to fountain water, according to the opinion of <hi>Hip. Galen,</hi> and <hi>Avicen.</hi> But there are many reaſons, why rain-water is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it. And firſt <hi>Celſus l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>The lightest Water is Rain, next Fountain, next River, next Well, next Snow, next Icie-water, the more heavie is Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, the heavieſt of all is Puddle-water. Aetius Tetrabib. l.</hi> 1. <hi>ſerm.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 165. Rain-water, ſaith he, is the lighteſt of all and is moſt quickly chang'd. <hi>Hip. l. de Aer. loc. &amp; aq.</hi> praiſes rain-water, as being light, ſweet, clear and thin; for that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lighteſt and thinneſt part is drawn up by the Sun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vitruv. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>The Water,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is collected from ſhowres, hath more wholſome vertues, becauſe it is drawn up from the moſt clear and ſubtle fountains, and then ſtrein'd by the motion of the air, it deſcends melting in ſhowres upon the earth. Averroes</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> ſaith, that rain-water is the beſt; and more excellent then river or fountain-water. Theſe authorities are backt alſo by experience, for rain-water being weigh'd, proves lighteſt, cools and heats quickly, oppreſſes not the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrium,</hi> but paſſes ſuddenly through the body, having neither in colour, ſmell, nor taſte any manifeſt quality. The thinneſs of it appears in this, that pulſe are ſooner boyled in it then in fountain-water. Beſides all ſorts of plants do ſhew the wholſomneſſe of rain-water; which are better nouriſhed with rain then with any artificial watring. Nay as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, <hi>reeds that grow in puddles, will not come to maturity nor increaſe without rain.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 8. <hi>l. de. hiſt. Animal.</hi> that the fiſh themſelves which live continually in the water, do not live nor engender well in dry years. You will ſay that the humours diſſolved into vapours and carried up by their levity to the ſtars, do borrow from them a certain vivifick vertue; which it afterwards imparts to the things below.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected that ſnow and hail are of the ſame matter with rain, yet the water which they melt into is rejected by all. <hi>Paulus</hi> anſwers, that ſnow and icie water is of all the moſt pernicious, becauſe all the thin parts are preſt out by the congelation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be objected out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that rain-water ſuddenly putrefies, and hath an aſtringent quality. But <hi>Paulus</hi> anſwers in theſe words, Let no man imagine putrefying water to be the worſt, when the proclivity which it hath to alteration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from its vertue, not from its vice. And <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>de fac. Alim.</hi> ſaith, that thoſe things which are eaſily concocted are eaſily corrupted; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thoſe things which are hard of digeſtion are ſlow to corrupt. As to the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:153522:148"/>binding quality, there is an anſwer given by <hi>Avicen,</hi> who ſaith that rain-water therefore ſeems binding, becauſe it is preſently diſtributed and paſſeth preſently to the urinary paſſages. Hence it happens that the excrements not being well moiſten'd, through their drineſſe beget aſtriction: for of it ſelf rain-water cannot binde, when as it is ſo thin and airy; for thoſe things that binde are of a terrene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath been ſaid it appears that rain-water ſeems to be preferred.</p>
                  <p>Yet with the conſent of moſt approved Authors, we do prefer the fountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it have the conditions before mentioned, it remains in the ſame ſtate, and is not altered by external cauſes. On the contrary rain-water requires ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which depend on outward things, that it is difficult for them all to concur; ſo that if any one of them be wanting, it neceſſarily loſeth of its perfection; that is, if it fall from tiles not well waſhed, or be kept in foul ciſterns, or be not fill'd up in a convenient time.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a doubt, when is the fitteſt time to receive this rain water, ſince there are not a few that do affirm from <hi>Hipp.</hi> that water preſerved in the ſummer time, and deſcending with thunder, is to be preferred by reaſon that it is the moſt thin and light. But notwithſtanding ſuch water by reaſon of its thinneſs and lightneſs, hath a certain prerogative, yet becauſe in the ſummer time various exhalations do ariſe out of the earth, which retain ſomething of the nature of minerals, and are mingled with the vapours, that cauſe rain, therefore thoſe waters are not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: which is hence manifeſt, becauſe they do ſuddenly putrefie, and worms are often bred therein. For lightning and thunder ariſe from ſulphurous exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do many times infect the air with their ſmell. Beſides in the ſummer time the waters of lakes, puddles, and ditches, contract a putrefaction, and the vapours that riſe from them, are part of the matter of rain, which is therefore viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eaſily corruptible. For theſe reaſons we prefer that water which is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſpring when the lakes, pools, and ditches are full of water, and that pure through the plenty of rain which fell in the winter. Beſides it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to preſerve for the whole year water enough in the ſummer, when there fals but little rain, and that not laſting many hours. And experience teaches us this, at <hi>Monſpeliers</hi> where they uſe much rain-water, and preſerve it in the ſpring and winter, that that is beſt which hath all the properties above mentioned, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the boyling of pulſe, whereby they grow extremely ſoft, when as in other waters they retain a hardneſſe, though for a longer time boyl'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well-water is thick and heavy, ſo that it ſticks in the bowels and begets obſtructions; yet there's a great difference between well-waters, ſo that ſome do contend in goodneſſe with the fountain, that is, if they have the following properties; if they have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of good water near them, for you may then imagine that they borrow their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thence.</hi> 2. <hi>If they be drawn out of deep wells; for ſuch are hot in the winter, and cold in the ſummer, and leſſe liable to external injuries.</hi> 3. <hi>If the ſun do freely come at them; For the light of the ſun doth purifie them, and communicates to them a certain vital ſpirit.</hi> 4. <hi>If they be often moved and exhauſted, for by that they are made thin and putrefie leſſe.</hi> 5. <hi>If they be well and often made clean.</hi> 6. <hi>If they are remote from privies and dunghils; whence they may derive any evil quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thoſe which have contrary qualities, are to be accounted noxious. For thoſe which are not deep unleſſe they arrive from ſome fountain, are liable to all external injuries, they freez in winter, are hot in ſummer, like ſtanding pools. If they be ſhut up under roofs, they are depriv'd of the light of the ſun, and are defiled with a ſlimy muck. If they be unmov'd they grow thick, remain raw, contract putrefaction, offend
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:153522:148"/>the ſtomack, paſs difficultly, and hurt the bowels. If they are near dunghils and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, they become tainted with an ill ſmell and ſavour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>River-waters contend with well waters for goodneſſe, and are ſometimes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them, ſometimes not ſo well to be eſteemed of. But there is great variety in river waters, for thoſe are beſt which are ſweet and clear, and drawn out of ſwift and rapid ſtreams, and which flow in good grounds and in a temperate region; but thoſe are bad which are drawn out of ſtill, muddy and troubled rivers, or out of great and running ſtreams which receive the filth of ſinks, kitchings, and privies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence rivers that run by the walls of great cities, have much filthineſſe in them, and generate many diſeaſes, unleſſe this caution be uſed, that the places deſtin'd for the drawing of water, be there only where no filth or excrement is caſt in. For otherwiſe, if the water which runs by a City be us'd, it is very unwholſome. This caution alſo is to be obſerved in the uſe of river-water, that it be kept in ciſterns for ſome daies, for it ſettles and all the terreſtrial and muddy parts ſink down to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The water of ſtanding pools and lakes is the worſt of all, for by reaſon they have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle motion, they ſoon putrefie, they are thick, raw, and ſometimes peſtilent and malignant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Snow water alſo and ice-water are very bad, for while they are congeal'd by the cold, the more thin parts exhale forth, beſides they have an extraordinary coldneſſe that hurts the ſtomack: which is to be alſo underſtood of ſnow and ice-water prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly uſed; for though young and ſtrong men do not preſently perceive the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as they grow old they finde it, and it brings them into various diſeaſes of the joynts, bowels and nervous parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With us it is in this age now in faſhion to drink ſnow and ice-water to cool themſelves, and not a few refrigerate their wine therewith. Which cuſtome is much diſputed about, not only among the Phyſitians, but alſo among the vulgar; ſome praiſing, other condemning it. Since therefore we have ſo fit an occaſion to ſpeak our opinion, we ſhall accordingly ſet down our judgement therein. Firſt in the Theorem, we have already condemn'd the drinking of water cold with ſnow, but with this addition, if it be prepoſterouſly uſed, which muſt be accurately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: for firſt of all that ſort of drink is ſo cold being generally conſidered, that it ſeems to be abſolutely condemned, according to the opinion of <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 51. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. to empty or fill much, or ſuddenly to heat or cool, or any other way to diſturb the body, is dangerous: for every exceſſe is an enemy to nature; but what is done by degrees is ſafe. Therefore when the body in the heat of ſummer is extraordinarily hot, to cool it ſuddenly with that icy drink, ſeems very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: the effect of this danger may be confirm'd by the many examples of thoſe who by uſing this drink, have fell into terrible diſeaſes, not a few of which we have ſeen and cured. On the other ſide they are infinite who extoll this drink to the skies, confirming their opinion both by reaſon and experience.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is taken hence, that our natural heat uſes violently to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and extinguiſhed, by two great enemies, the cold extinguiſhing, and the heat diſſipating; which makes our bodies in the vehement heat of ſummer to be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and faint, the hot air as it were inflaming the parts of our body, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their heat; which diſſolution cannot be hindred but by the taking and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of refrigerating things. And therefore as in all ages, baths, and ſwimming in cold water have been conveniently us'd to temper this heat of the body, ſo alſo cold drink inwardly taken, produceth the ſame effects.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, drink is neceſſary to reſtore the natural moiſture, which is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed and diſſipated by the natural heat; but drink, as being moiſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:153522:149"/>that work: yet if heat were joyned with this moiſture, it would forward the reſolution of the moiſture; and therefore generally men deſire cold drink in the very winter time, to temper that internal heat, and ſtop the reſolution. But it is much more neceſſary in the ſummer time, when there is a great diſſipation of the moiſture through the intenſe heat of the bowels.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the coldeſt drink us'd in the ſummer, is beſt, as appears by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of many men who affirm, that they have been freed from many diſeaſes by drinking water cold with ice or ſnow. Alſo in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> from the time that this drink came in uſe, malign and peſtilent Feavers are leſſe common in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then formerly.</p>
                  <p>But our opinion is this. Firſt there is no doubt but that drink moderately cold is moſt convenient for all men. And therefore it hath been an old cuſtome for men to preſerve their Wine in cellars under ground, for their uſe in ſummer, and to draw water out of the deepeſt wells if they be good, and to mix them in their Wine; if not good, to cool their Wine in the wells themſelves. And we can teach them to make their Wine more cold that way, if they put down the pots of Wine into the well ſo low as the noſe thereof do not touch the water, for the air which is near the water is more cold, and pierces the bottles ſooner then the water it ſelf. But for drink cool'd with ice and ſnow, which hath a more intenſe and freezing coldneſſe; there is more difficulty in that. Therefore as to that the above mentioned Aphoriſm of <hi>Hipp.</hi> is of great force, <hi>to cool or heat much and ſuddenly, is dangerous.</hi> To the reſolving of which doubt, we ſay that in a countrey and ſeaſon very hot, it may be us'd by young men of a ſtrong nature, hot temper, and free from ill humours. For then the bowels require ſuch things as are ſtrong and forcible, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they have been us'd to ſuch drink, with much exerciſe. But to others who are aged, or very young, and have weak entrails, of a flegmatick or melancholy temper, and full of excrementitious humours, living an idle life, and accuſtoming themſelves to little exerciſe, and much venery, it is moſt dangerous. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are ſo many circumſtances required to make this drink uſefull, and thoſe found in ſo few men, it is better to abſtain from it, and to uſe drink cool'd after the ſame manner as I have related, which is moſt convenient for the preſervation of health.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the cuſtom of cooling Wine with ice is now ſo much in faſhion, that many are forced to drink it at banquets wanting other drink, whence I have ſeen many very much to ſuffer; We have thought it worth the while to invent a way to make it leſſe dangerous. And therefore we give this precept, that before they drink they eat good ſtore of meat, and thoſe hot, ſalted and peppered, by which the ſtomack being heated, may be able the better to reſiſt the vehement coldneſſe of the drink. Next, let him drink but little, and that but little mingled. And to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thirſt, recompenſe the ſmalneſſe of the quantity by often drinking; for ſo the harm of that cold drink may be pretty well avoided. The ſame caution they may obſerve who are of a hotter temper, who in the dog daies are very fiery, and ſubject to burning Feavers, and therefore drink this ſort of drink, hoping thereby great benefit, that they do not uſe it for ſome few daies, but in a little quantity and often drinking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wine generally conſidered, in the active qualities is hot, in the paſſive dry. It che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes our heat, ſtrengthens the heart, increaſes the ſpirits, refreſhes the ſtrength, purges choler by urine, and forwards the expulſion of all the excrements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Wine generally conſidered, we mean, that which principally deſerves to be called Wine, and which growes in hot or temperate Countreys, and is preſſed out
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:153522:149"/>of ripe grapes, and rightly made in the tub: yet there is ſo much difference, that ſome is hot and dry in the third degree, ſome in the ſecond, and ſome in the fourth degree. But that which is preſſed from unripe grapes, which is ſowre and ſharp, deſerves not the name of Wine.</p>
                  <p>But concerning the paſſive qualities of Wine, great difficulty ariſes, by reaſon that both authorities and reaſons differ therein.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>Ariſtot.</hi> 17. <hi>Prob. ſect.</hi> 3. ſaith expreſly that Wine is hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>de cauſ. pulſ. c. ult.</hi> affirms that Wine ſpeedily nouriſhes by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its moiſture, and that ſo much the more becauſe it is hot.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſan tuen. c.</hi> 11. forbids Wine to children for many cauſes, but eſpecially becauſe it moiſtens them too much, and fils them with vapours: and in the ſame place he writes that Wine moiſtens what ever is immoderately and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily dry.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſan. tuen. c.</hi> 5. ſaith that Wine is moſt fit for old men, not only becauſe of the weak heat which then they have, but becauſe of its moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Plato</hi> 2. <hi>de leg.</hi> ſaith that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> gave Wine to men as a remedy againſt the hardneſſe of old age, that they might ſeem to wax young again; their bodies being ſoftned in Wine as iron in fire.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Hipp. of diet.</hi> That black ſweet Wines, and thin ſweet Wines do moiſten.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The juice of ripe grapes of which Wine is made is hot and moiſt. <hi>Hipp.</hi> 2. <hi>de diaeta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Wine is moſt grateful to humane nature which is hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Wine is good for melancholy people, who require moiſtening: whence the proverb, As long as they are moiſtened, ſo long they are cured.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, that Wine is dry, ſeems prov'd by the following reaſons and authorities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 8. <hi>ſimpl. de vin.</hi> That heat and drineſſe are equally proportioned in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Paulus Aegineta l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 3. confirms this opinion of <hi>Galen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Aetius tetrab. ſec. c. de vin.</hi> ſaith old Wine is hot in the third degree.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Synopſ. c.</hi> 15. he ſaith, Wine is dry in the ſecond degree. And <hi>c.</hi> 16. in the third degree, if it be very old.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Wine contains much ſpirit, being of a fiery nature and eaſily inflam'd.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is good for flegmatick, and being immoderately drunk, it provokes thirſt, and parches the bowels, whence a red colour and pimples in the face of drunkards.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, It is moſt uſeful for the cure of ulcers, as <hi>Gal.</hi> teaches, 4. <hi>meth. c.</hi> 5. but ulcers are cured by cleanſing and drying.</p>
                  <p>For the deciſion of this controverſie there is a double diſtinction to be obſerved, the one as to moiſture, the other as to the Wine.</p>
                  <p>The moiſture is twofold, actual, and potential; and both theſe natural or artificial.</p>
                  <p>Wine is either unripe, ſowre and imperfect, or ripe and perfectly concocted. Then ſecondly, it is either new or old, and both theſe either ſtrong or ſmall.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, we ſay that Wine is actually moiſt, when as every fluid ſubſtance is actually moiſt. Potentially it is dry if it be ripe, generous, and not too new, as we have ſet down in the Theoreme.</p>
                  <p>But that which is crude and acid, very new, as alſo ſweet, is more predominant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moiſt. For being raw, it abounds with a flegmatick watry moiſture, rather na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural then accidental: being new, it abounds with much moiſture, that is conſum'd by fermentation in the tub.</p>
                  <p>Having thus premiſed theſe diſtinctions, we ſhall let alone the authorities and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:153522:150"/>reaſons brought for the drineſſe thereof, and only anſwer to thoſe that are brought for the moiſture thereof.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt we ſay, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals Wine actually moiſt, not potentially.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond we anſwer, That <hi>Galen</hi> conſiders Wine as it nouriſhes, in which reſpect it is moiſt actually, and by reaſon of that actuall humidity, it is eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed and changed; whence we ſay that it ſpeedily nouriſhes.</p>
                  <p>To the third we reply, That <hi>Galen</hi> forbids children to drink Wine, not that it doth potentially, but actually moiſten them; for it heats and fils the head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and ſo cauſes many diſeaſes, but chiefly convulſions.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth we anſwer, That <hi>Galen</hi> commends Wine to old men, not that it moiſtens, but becauſe it refreſhes their weak heat, and evacuates by urine the ſerous humours, wherewith they abound.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth we anſwer, That <hi>Plato</hi> when he ſaith that Wine is a remedy againſt old age, underſtands not the hardneſſe of the body, but the minde; for he ſaith, that they ought to drink Wine to make them young again, and to comfort and cheer their ſpirits; for the affection of the minde, like iron moiſten'd in the fire, being once ſoftned growes more flexible.</p>
                  <p>To the ſixth we ſay, That the authority of <hi>Hipp.</hi> is not contrary to our opinion, who in the deciſion of the controverſie, have affirmed that ſowre-ſweet Wine is predominantly moiſt.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeventh we affirm that <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſpeaks of new Wine, which he cals the juice of ripe Grapes; and that we confeſſe is predominantly moiſt.</p>
                  <p>To the eighth we make anſwer, That Wine is pleaſing to our nature, becauſe it nouriſhes ſpeedily, and recreates the ſpirits, which effects are not hindred by the drying quality, which is very moderate, and not much differing from humane nature.</p>
                  <p>To the ninth we anſwer, That it is good for melancholy perſons, not as it moiſtens, but as it recreates the ſpirits, comforts the heart, and excites gladneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſeverall differences of Wine, that are taken from the nature, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſmell, colour, and age; which differ alſo much in their faculties and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                  <p>As to the proper nature of Wines; ſome Wine is call'd <hi>Oligoforon,</hi> becauſe it indures little mixture of water, other Wines are ſtronger, and endure a greater mixture, and by how much the ſtronger, ſo much the hotter and dryer it is.</p>
                  <p>As to the taſte, ſweet Wines nouriſh well, and are covetouſly ſuckt in by the bowels. Yet they are thicker and beget obſtructions, ſwell the Hypochondriums, increaſing wind through their thickneſs, and being eaſily turned into choler. They are good for the lungs, neither are they over hot, neither do they afflict the head, or the nerves: which are related by <hi>Hip.</hi> 2. <hi>de rat. vict.</hi> in acute diſeaſes, text. 2 .</p>
                  <p>Auſtere and ſharp Wines are of a weak colour, they ſtay long in the belly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they eaſily pierce the veins, or fall down through the urinary paſſages; they are bad in affection of the Lungs: they are good in fluxes of the belly, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a binding quality.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſmell, odoriferous and fragrant Wines are moſt commended, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the ſtrength, refreſh the ſpirits, are good for old men, only they fill the head and the nerves, and therefore they are bad for thoſe that are troubled with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs and other affections of the head.</p>
                  <p>From the colour, a certain judgement cannot be made of the vertues, for ſome white Wines are leſſe watery and ſtrong, others more watery and ſmal; generally the white Wines heat more then the brown and yellow: among the brown Wines the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:153522:150"/>moſt generous are Rheniſh, Cretan, and Muſcatell; Of the red ſome are more, ſome leſſe ſtrong. But for the moſt part, thoſe that have a deep red, and come neareſt to a blackneſſe, ſo much the leſſe generous they are; and by how much the thicker they are, by ſo much they obſtruct the more. But thin Wines open the paſſages, provoke ſweat and urine, though they nouriſh leſſe then the thick.</p>
                  <p>As to the age, new Wines, which as yet keep the taſte of the muſte, are more watery and weaker then is convenient for Wine; they are excrementitious and of a hard concoction: they do not ſufficiently forward the diſtribution of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, but keep it long in the belly, and ſwell the Hypochondriums, they cauſe heavie dreams, obſtruct the bowels, and beget the ſtone, eſpecially thoſe which are ſweet, thick, troubled, and not well cleanſed, ſtill retaining the nature of the Muſte.</p>
                  <p>Old Wines which were at firſt ſtrong, are more ſharp and heady, and they heat more then ordinary: they hurt the head and nerves, eaſily intoxicate, and attenuate the body by daily uſe, and they are hurtful to hot tempers, unleſſe they be well mixed ere they be drank. Yet in ſome cold Regions, Wines that are auſtere and ſharp are better and more wholſome after the ſecond or third year, and by a longer concoction they loſe their auſterity.</p>
                  <p>Wines of a middle age, are moſt convenient for the diet of ſound and unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons; eſpecially if they be well ſetled and purged; for the heat of the Wine puts it ſelf out in longer time, being leſſe potent in new, more in middle age, and moſt of all in old Wines.</p>
                  <p>But although that there are various ſorts of Wine, which are more convenient for various tempers and natures; yet generally the properties of the beſt Wine and moſt convenient for all ſorts of men, is that which hath a taſte between ſweet and ſharp, fragrant to the ſmell, and a little yellowiſh, neither too thick, nor thin, yet more thin then thick; nor too ſtrong, nor too ſmall, but of a middle age.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Air which is moſt wholſome for all men, and fittest for their health, ought in its firſt qualities to be temperate, pure, clean, thin, open and free, without any ill vapours, moiſtneſſe or corruption, but winow'd with gentle and ſoft breathing winds, and for the moſt part ſerene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is unwholſome which is infected with the vapours of ſtanding pools and lakes, or receives a peſtilent air from any vault, or from the jakes of a great City, from
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:153522:151"/>ſlaughter-houſes, or leather-dreſſers yards, or ſtinking dunghils. That which is near any lake or great river, is full of miſts and dampneſſe, that which is in a valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with mountains, hath no wind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The air affects our bodies two waies, either as it incompaſſes them, or as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates it ſelf into the pores and breathing holes of the body; or as it is drawn by the Lungs. Either way it hath a very great force to affect and alter our bodies: while it communicates all its qualities to the ſpirits, and by the ſpirits to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of our bodies: which if it be wholſome for the body, it very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the preſervation of health, but if they be averſe from the temper and conſtitution thereof, it cauſes many diſeaſes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſan. tuen.</hi> ſaith it is moſt wholeſome for every body to draw the beſt air into the Lungs, that pure ſpirits may be thereby generated; as it is moſt peſtilent, to live in a bad air. And <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi> 1. <hi>de re Ruſt. c.</hi> 3. ſaith that in buying ground, the wholeſomneſſe of the air is firſt to be lookt at. For no ſound man ought to lay out his money in a peſtilent air, though never ſo fruitful a ſoil, when the enjoyment thereof is ſo hazardous. And therefore a temperate air both for heat and cold is to be ſought, almoſt begirt with a hill, which neither freezes with continual froſt in the winter, nor too much evaperates in the ſummer, nor at the top of a hill ſubject to all wind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An exquiſitely tempered air, as it were in the middle between hot and cold, moiſt and dry, fits a contrary conſtitution beſt.</hi> So it is better for thoſe of a hot temper to live in a moiſt air, and for thoſe that are of a colder temper, to live in a hot air: thoſe that are dry love a moiſt, thoſe that are moiſt love a dry aire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when every one cannot finde out an air fit and proper for his conſtitution, we muſt ſupply by art, what nature denies. Thus a hot air is to be cooled, a cold air heated; a moiſt to be dry'd, a dry air moiſten'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If for a hot body we want a cold air, which is not ſuch either through the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Countrey or houſe, it muſt be brought to a coldneſſe by often watering, by the uſe of cold flowers and plants, by opening windows to the north, that the wind may cool the houſe. If the air be cold, it muſt be heated with good fires, all the crannies and inlets of the houſe muſt be ſtopped up to hinder the approach of the cold; or elſe to live in a ſtove, as the Germans and all the northern people do. A moiſt air muſt be dry'd by ſuffumigations and fires; a dry air by irrigations of waters muſt be moiſten'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A hot air renders the body hot, melts the humours, attenuates and diſſolves them, weakens the natural strength, if the heat be immoderate, weakens concoction and makes life ſhort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have the <hi>Lybians,</hi> and thoſe that inhabit the ſun burnt parts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> to be ſhort liv'd becauſe the ſundries up their natural heat, and haſtens age through the dryneſſe of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A cold air cools the body, thickens, bindes and helps concoction, increaſes plenty of urine, cauſeth Catarrhs and other diſeaſes of the head, if the cold be intenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heat being driven inward by the force of the <hi>ambient</hi> air, is more ſtrong and vigorous. Therefore <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the belly is hotter in winter,</hi> by which heat concoction is the ſooner performed. Cold air increaſes urine by reaſon that the pores of the body being ſhut, the humours that were to expire, being kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, condenſe, and are carried to the paſſages of the urine; and therefore the matter of ſweat and urine is the ſame: ſo that the ſweat flowing out, there is leſſe plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of urine; and the ſweat being ſtopped, there comes forth a greater plenty of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:153522:151"/>urine. So common experience teaches that in winter time, and when the North wind blows, men do piſſe in greater quantity. But in the ſummer time and when the South winds blow, in a far leſſe quantity: but if the cold be intenſe, it cauſes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs through the coldneſſe of the brain, cold being very hurtfull to the brain, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches in Aph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A moiſt air ſoftens the skin, moiſtens the body, increaſes excrements, makes it ſlow and heavy, brings a dulneſſe upon the wit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A dry air dries the body, diminiſheth the excrements, makes the body nimble, and the ſenſes quick.</hi>

                  <p>TO the air are referred the ſeaſons of the year, becauſe of the great variety in them.</p>
                  <p>Aſtrologers have divided the year into four equall parts: So that the Spring ſhould begin, the Sun entring into <hi>Aries,</hi> and end when he leaves <hi>Gemini.</hi> The Summer from the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> to the end of <hi>Virgo,</hi> Autumn from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Libra</hi> to the end of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and Winter from the beginning of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn</hi> to the end of <hi>Piſces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Phyſitians and divers people, meaſure the ſeaſons of the year by the temper of the air, and as the air in ſome places is naturally more hot, in others colder, there the ſummer, there the winter is longer. So</hi> Hipp. <hi>defines the winter in</hi> Thaſus <hi>where he liv'd,</hi> 3. de diaet. <hi>From the ſetting of the Pleiades or the beginning of</hi> Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>to the vernal Equinoctial; the Spring from the vernal Equinox to the riſing of the Pleiades, or the</hi> 7. <hi>day of</hi> May; <hi>the Summer, from the riſing of the Pleiades, to the riſing of Arcturus, or the middle of</hi> September; <hi>Autumn from the riſing of Arcturus to the ſetting of the Pleiades. By which computation, four moneths and ten daies are allowed the Winter, and as many to the Summer, but two moneths only and ſome daies to the Spring, and hardly two moneths to Autumn. In the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countreys the cold is moſt fierce in the Equinox, that the Winter ſeaſon may be ſaid to laſt five moneths and more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proſper Alpinus l.</hi> 1. <hi>de med. Aegypt. c.</hi> 7. writes that the air is remperate in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that the Spring flouriſhes in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> that the Summer begins in <hi>March,</hi> and laſts to the end of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> that Autumn is in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> and that the Winter laſts only <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December:</hi> therefore from the temper of the air the times of the year according to the doctrine of the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are to be defin'd by the following Theorems.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Spring is the moſt temperate of all the ſeaſons of the year, and is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between the firſt qualities, neither being over cold and moiſt as in the Winter, nor over hot and dry as in the Summer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:153522:152"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hipp.</hi> in his Book of Humane Nature, ſaith, that the Spring is hot and moiſt, which is to be underſtood in compariſon of other ſeaſons; for in reſpect of the Winter, it may be ſaid to be hot, in reſpect of Summer, cold: but conſidered in it ſelf without any other relation, it may be ſaid to be temperate. Which <hi>Galen</hi> ſhows in his firſt Book of Temperaments, by common experience. For ſeeing that we do not freeze as in Winter, the Spring keeping its natural conſtitution, nor are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with heat as in the Summer, nor abound with humors, nor are tormented with drought, nor feel any manifeſt exceſſe of theſe qualities, we muſt neceſſarily judge the ſpring to be temperate. But this moderate temper is not to be found through the whole courſe of the Spring, for at the beginning it reſembles Winter, and at the end it is like Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Spring is the moſt wholeſome ſeaſon of the year, according to <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>The Spring approaching, our bodies which were bound in Winter, begin to be looſe and rarifi'd; the bloud increaſes, the ſpirits revive, and all things ſeem glad for the diſſolution of Winters froſt. Neither is it abſurd to ſay that many diſeaſes are bred in Winter; ſince the Spring naturally brings health, not diſeaſes, and if it finde the body in good eſtate, ſo preſerves it. But if there be an an abundance of humours collected in the Winter, in the Spring they are melted and ſtirred, and ſometimes putrefie, which cauſes various ſorts of diſeaſes. And the Spring by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, not of its own proper nature is ſaid to beget diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>You will object again, that the Spring is hot and moiſt according to <hi>Hipp.</hi> but a hot and moiſt conſtitution is unwholeſome, and moſt liable to breed diſeaſes that ſpring from putrefaction. Therefore the Spring cannot be ſaid to be moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that that is in the exceſſe of heat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> but where the heat exceeds the cold, and the moiſture exceeds the drineſſe moderately, that temper is moſt wholeſome and moſt agreeing with humane nature, which inclines to heat and moiſture. Beſides, life conſiſts in hot and moiſt, and muſt be preſerved by things of that temper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſummer is hot and dry, it renders the body hot, dry, faint, thirſty, and weak, it attenuates and burns the humours, it increaſes choler, which is the cauſe of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of cholerick Feavers at that time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Autumn is cold and dry, fruitful of diſeaſes, becauſe of the inequality of its tempers: for in the morning 'tis cold, at noon very hot, and laſtly at evening 'tis cold again. The body is condenſed at that time, and the humours hindred from flowing, being forc'd to the interiour parts by the coldneſſe of the air, whence ariſe many diſeaſes very dangerous, by reaſon of the black choler which abounds in the body in Autumn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Winter is cold and moiſt, it ſtrengthens the body and makes it more lively and full of natural heat, and cauſes long ſleeps through the tediouſneſſe of the nights, it procreates flegm, and makes the body liable to obſtructions.</p>

                     <hi>MOtion and exerciſe are a principal means for the preſervation of health, above all other things except temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the common ſentence of <hi>Hipp.</hi> may be fitly repeated, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>Epid. The way to preſerve health is not to glut the ſtomack with meat, and to be laborious in exerciſe. Galen</hi> in many places chiefly commends exerciſe, but in one place chiefly where he prefers it before temperance in diet: <hi>in lib. de ſuc. bon. &amp; vit. c.</hi> 2. <hi>Unleſſe a man exerciſe ſufficiently, he cannot preſerve himſelf from diſeaſes by any temperance in diet; unleſſe he do recompenſe the want of exerciſe by requiſite purgation, or letting of bloud. But if he uſe a through exerciſe, though he ſometimes exceed in diet, yet he ſhall continue without diſeaſes.</hi> But <hi>Ariſtot. Prob.</hi> 47. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. queſtioning why it is good to diminiſh his diet and increaſe his labour, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of humours cauſeth diſeaſes, which ſhew themſelves chiefly, when either a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in diet, or is wanting in exerciſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motion and exerciſe excite the natural heat, increaſe and ſtir up the ſpirits, ſo that the body becomes more ſtrong, leſſe liable to external injuries, and fitter to undertake all actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concoction is perfected better by the increaſe of heat, and the ſtirring and exagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirits cauſeth a more plentifull tranſpiration, the defect whereof is the cauſe of almost all diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there are many ſorts of motion and exerciſe, as walking, running, leaping, riding, geſtation, and infinite others: of which, ſome exerciſe the body more, ſome leſſe; others the whole body, others but ſome parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> commends the play with the little ball chiefly, as that which exerciſes the whole body; running and walking exerciſe the thighs particularly; by handling arms and rowing, the arms and ſuperiour parts are exerciſed; by ſinging, hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and loud reading, the voice and breſt, by riding the ſtomack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt uſed, and moſt commodious kinde of exerciſe, is moderate walking through green and pleaſant places under a clear and ſerene skie. But they that are ſoon weary of walking through infirmity, or cannot walk free enough, may more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ride on horſeback.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moderate walking exerciſes almoſt the whole body, cauſeth an appetite, excites the natural heat, ſtrengthens the body, and helps toward the evacuation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To make exerciſe profitable for the body, two things are to be obſerved; time, and meaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fit time is before meat, chiefly before dinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Exerciſe is more convenient before meat, becauſe the former meal being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, the relicks of the excrements are evacuated by exerciſe and diſſipated: and ſo the body is the better diſpoſed to concoct and receive new nouriſhment. Whence <hi>Galen</hi> 1. <hi>de ſan. tuen. c.</hi> 2. bids him that hath not concocted reſt altogether. But exerciſe after dinner is worſt of all, for it carries the crude humours into the veins, obſtructs the liver, oppreſſes the head, and cauſes many diſeaſes. For this cauſe Scholars are often troubled with the Itch, becauſe they exerciſe after dinner, which carries the meat out of the ſtomack before due concoction, and fils it full of crude
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:153522:153"/>humours, which vehement exerciſe carries to the skin, where they turn to ſcabs. The ſame happens to thoſe that exerciſe when the body is in an ill temper and full of vicious humours: which produces ſcabs and ulcers. As teaches <hi>Hipp.</hi> 6. <hi>Epid. ſect.</hi> 5. <hi>If he labour unpurg'd ſcabs will break forth.</hi> Exerciſe before dinner is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then before ſupper, becauſe in the morning the ſtomack is empty, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction better perfected, by reaſon of the greater ſpace of time between din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſupper: on the contrary, the meat eaten at dinner is not ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>
                  <p>Yet a gentle walking after meat, is uſefull as that which recals the heat, and haſtens not away the meat, but cauſes it to deſcend to the bottom of the ſtomack, where it is more quickly concocted, and helps the diſtribution of the meat alſo when it is concocted.</p>
                  <p>The meaſure of exerciſe is appointed by <hi>Galen,</hi> 2. <hi>de ſan. tuen. c. ult.</hi> which may be referred to four heads. 1. To continue exerciſe till the body ſwell. 2. Till it appear freſh and lively. 3. Till a wearineſſe come upon it. 4. Till a moderate ſweat or hot vapour break forth: any of which appearing, then deſiſt from exerciſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SLeep is abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of health, and if it be moderate it helps concoction, refreſhes and reſtores the ſtrength loſt in the time of watching, moistens the inner parts of the body, and is conducible to old men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the good which comes to men from ſleep, is to be aſcribed to the retraction of the heat to the inner parts. For the heat increaſed in the bowels generates co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious ſpirits, and reſtores them that were loſt in the time of watching: which helps the concoction in the liver, and ſeveral other parts; and forwards the expulſion of the excrements: and becauſe that weakneſſe of the body, which comes by watching, proceeds from a loſſe of ſpirits, thoſe being reſtored, wearineſſe then leaves a man. But by concoction plenty of the nouriſhing humour is afforded to the internal parts, which moiſtens them very much, as <hi>Hipp.</hi> taught 6. <hi>Epid. Exerciſe is meat to the joynts, ſleep is nouriſhment to the bowels.</hi> Laſtly, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces much to old men, becauſe there is nothing more which heats and moiſtens their cold and dry bodies, and ſo it reſtores the moiſt ſubſtance being loſt. Whence that of <hi>Homer</hi> cited by <hi>Galen, de ſan. tu. As ſoon as he hath bathed and eaten, let him ſleep, for his age requires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Immoderate ſleep looſens the members, cauſes an ill colour and habit of body, makes the head heavy, filling it full of vapours and humours, duls the natural heat, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all the parts of the body more unapt to exerciſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This proceeds from an over long retention of the excrements, which are cauſed by immoderate ſleep; for 'tis moſt true, that fleep hinders all evacuations but ſweat; ſo that after concoction perfected, if the excrements which ought to be preſently after evacuated, are kept in the body, it makes it ſubject to all the above mentioned inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In going to ſleep, three things are to be regarded, the time, ſpace, and manner of lying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:153522:153"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt convenient time for ſleep is the night, an hour or two after ſupper, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle walk preceding, that the meat may the better deſcend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The night is fitteſt for ſleep through the moiſture and tranquillity thereof, and it affords time long enough to finiſh concoction, ſo that it is not neceſſary to break ſleep for buſineſſe ſake, as fals out in day-naps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sleep at noon is very hurtfull, eſpecially to thoſe that have not uſed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the time wherein a man ſleeps by day, ſuffices not to finiſh concoction. Hence it comes to paſſe that they who ſleep after dinner, being raiſed out their ſleep, becauſe of an interrupted concoction, feel a heavineſſe in their ſtomack, belch ſowre belches, are fill'd with wind, and have no appetite at ſupper. Beſides ſleep by day, filling the brain with over-much moiſture, begets Catarrhs and other diſeaſes of the head; for it fils the brain with moiſture, which is done ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in the night time, ſo that there is no reaſon to oppreſſe the head in the day time with moiſture, but rather by waking to dry up that moiſture, which for the moſt part is exceſſive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if any one by reaſon of their labour in the morning, or a weakneſſe of the body, as in ſickly people, become weary, as alſo not having ſlept the night before, he may ſleep then in the after noon without danger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay an afternoon-nap may be profitable, if very ſhort, which may only ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the heat to the internal parts, for the better perfecting concoction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if it laſt not long, it cannot fill the head with vapours, and yet it recreates the ſtrength, and rather diſſipates the vapours in the brain then gathers it, the heat being for a ſmall while drawn inward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alſo in long and hot daies, ſleep in the afternoon is lawful to thoſe that do uſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the nights being ſhort and oft-times unquiet, it is lawful to ſleep at noon, eſpecially to thoſe that have uſed it, that the want of ſleep in the night may be recompenſed by ſleeping after dinner. Beſide, that the ſpirits which the heat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, are reſtor'd by ſleeping. But ſuch ſleep profits them moſt that are us'd to it; as among the <hi>Italians,</hi> who all the ſummer ſleep in the afternoon and receive great benefit thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As often as a man indulges to that afternoons ſleep, it ought to be very long or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why it ought to be very ſhort, the reaſon is given before; why very long, is becauſe if the ſleep be interrupted before full concoction, the concoction is diſturb'd, which cauſes many diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet ſleep at noon hurts leſſe if it be taken with the body upright and not lying down; for ſo the vapours have a freer paſſage to aſcend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither must a man ſleep preſently after dinner, but after a ſhort ſpace and ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle walking, that the meat may deſcend to the bottome of the ſtomack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſpace appointed for ſleep, is taken from the perfection of the concoction in the ſtomack and liver; and that from the concoction of the urine, and cheerfulneſſe of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now ſome having a quicker, ſome a ſlower digeſtion, thoſe ought to ſleep leſſe, theſe more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So gluttons, men full of humours, flegmatick women, and thoſe that have weak ſtomacks require longer ſleep, becauſe they need a greater retraction of the heat: A ſhorter ſleep ſuffices fat, temperate, thick, and well concocting perſons. Laſtly, a moderate ſleep muſt be us'd by thoſe that are ſound and in good temper, which is commonly allowed to be for ſeven or eight hours ſpace.</p>
                  <p>The manner of lying in the bed ought to be with the head higheſt, on either ſide,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:153522:154"/>but firſt on the right, then on the left; lying on the belly helps concoction, but it hurts the ſight; lying on the back hinders the evacuation of the excrements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dangerous for thoſe that are ſubject to the Stone.</p>
                  <p>A more erected manner of lying, makes the head freer from excrements: lying on the right ſide cauſes the meat to deſcend to the bottom of the ſtomack, and is eaſier for reſpiration, lying on the left, forwards concoction through the nearneſſe of the liver to the ſtomack.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adds, that a man muſt not lie ſtraight, but with his limbs ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up, for the warmth of the belly.</p>
                  <p>Moderate watchings quicken the ſenſes, diffuſe ſpirit and heat into all the parts of the body, help the diſtribution of the nouriſhment, and further the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excrements. But immoderate watching conſumes and diſſipates the ſpirits, dries up the body, but chiefly the brain, increaſes choler, inflames, and is the cauſe oft-times of hot diſeaſes. Sometimes alſo of coldneſſe, the heat being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated and conſumed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The excrements of the belly, if they do not come forth in due time, binder concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deprave the appetite, and beget nauſeouſneſſe, putrid vapours ariſing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained excrements to the ſtomack, that cauſe colick pains, the wind being hindred from coming forth, together with giddineſſe and head-ache, the fumes ariſing to the head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But coming naturally forth, they are ſoft, of a middle ſubſtance, of a brown colour, yet not ſtinking very much; the quantity correſponding with the quantity of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Natural urine is of a moderate ſubſtance, of a brown colour, either with or without a ſediment, white, ſmooth, and correſponding in quantity to the liquor taken in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inſenſible tranſpiration, if it be prohibited, by a ſtoppage of the external pores, by the ambient cold, or of the internal, by the bad humours retain'd, cauſes very great diſeaſes, as Pleureſies, Peripneumonies, putrid Feavers, &amp;c. but being according to nature, it preſerves the body in health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we muſt obſerve what <hi>Sanctorius</hi> hath ſaid of inſenſible tranſpiration, <hi>l. de ſtat. Med.</hi> where he affirms that more excrements are voided by inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, then by all other evacuations taken together, which no Phyſitians till then ever knew; yet this he ſaith he hath found by the experience of thirty years, in ſeveral bodies exactly weighed both before and after meat, and after voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their excrements; which are all to be ſeen in the Author, or in <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his Theory of putrid Feavers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The flux of the Flowres ought to be moderate according to the temper and cuſtome of the woman, obſerving certain intervals, and certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</hi>

                     <hi>Otherwiſe being ſuppreſſed, or immederately flowing, they are the cauſe of many diſeaſes.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the excretion of ſeed, is referred the uſe of Venery, which if it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate offends not the health, though a man may want it without hurt; as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches in Monks and Batchelors. For in thoſe the ſeminal matter is tranſmitted to ſeveral parts, and conſum'd in the nouriſhment of them; but the ſeminal parts dry, and are made incapable of their function.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The immoderate uſe of Venery hurts men more then women, diſſolves the ſpirits, refrigerates the body, weakens the brain, eyes, nerves, ſtomack and joynts, duls the ſenſes, and begets crudities and ſtinking breath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fitteſt age for Venery is youth and middle age, it is hurtful to others, eſpecially old men, and men of dry and weak conſtitutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such intervals are to be obſerved, as</hi> Galen <hi>teaches, that a man may ſeem more light and nimble then before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spring is a fitter time for Venery then the Winter, Autumn leſſe, and leaſt of all the Summer: at which time it is better to abſtain.</p>
                  <p>As to the parts of the day, Venery is moſt uſefull in the morning, or after a mans firſt ſleep; the concoction perfected, and not after meat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis moſt hurtful after hard drinking, ſtrong exerciſes, in time of famine, or after long evacuations.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Paſsions of the Minde have a great influence upon the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the body; ſo that not only extreme ſickneſſe, but death alſo ſometimes happens from the immoderate exceſſe of them; being moderate, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He therefore that labours to preſerve his health, ought to ſeek tranquillity of minde, and reſiſt vehement paſsion. For ſo the body is preſerved in its natural ſtate, and the paſsions cauſe no change in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But becauſe it is impoſsible to be free from all the paſsions, a man muſt labour to reſiſt them with all his force, and to bridle their violence. Now the effects of theſe paſsions or of the chief of them, we ſhall briefly lay down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moderate joy chiefly conduces of all the other affections to the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of health; for by that the heat, ſpirits and bloud are diffuſed to the whole body: exciting the vigour of the faculties, nouriſhing and moiſtening the habit thereof, and gracing it with a lively colour. Hence that of the Wiſe man, <hi>A cheerful heart makes age youthful.</hi> But immoderate joy diſſipates the ſubſtance of the ſpirits, diſſolves the ſtrength of the vital faculties, whence proceed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and ſudden death oft-times, eſpecially in old people, women, and weak conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sadneſſe weakens the natural heat, cools and dries the body, makes the face pale, leſſens the pulſe, and by a straightning of the heart oft times cauſes Feavers, hindring the dilation thereof, whence ariſes putrefaction in the humours.</hi> Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. l. de vir. Cor. c. 6. <hi>ſaith that two things do proceed from ſadneſſe, a weakneſſe of the natural faculty, through an extinction of the heat, and a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fear cals the heat ſuddenly to the heart, which cauſes the outward parts to wax pale, cold, and tremble, the teeth to chatter, an interrupted ſpeech, and decay of the ſtrength; ſometimes it looſens the belly, and cauſes an ejection of urine, a weakneſſe and reſolution of the muſcles; death ſometimes enſues, abundance of bloud being call'd to the heart, by which it is oppreſſed, and the vital faculty extinguiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anger vehemently ſtirs the heat and ſpirits, increaſes and quickens the pulſe, whets the choler and increaſes quotidian and putrefi'd Feavers. If it be too outragious, it overcomes the reaſon and moves it from its ſeat. It profits cold natures, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the weaker heat and enlivens it.</hi>

               <head>THE PROEME.</head>
               <p>THE Method of Curing, is by Authors ſaid to be twofold, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Particular. The general Method is that which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the common Precepts which are for the curing of all ſorts of Diſeaſes; and ſhewes what Remedies are proper for ſimilar, what for organick, and what for common Diſeaſes. The particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſhews how every Species of diſeaſes is to be cured, hapning to every part from the head to the foot: which Method is obſerved in their works which they call Practick. And this univerſal cure of particular Diſeaſes depends upon the common Precepts, which are ſet down in the general Method: and is nothing elſe but a practiſe of the general Method upon all the ſeveral Species of Diſeaſes, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the body. Now becauſe the dogmatical Method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick proceeds alwaies by way of Indication, therefore this our Tractate ſhall comprehend four Sections; The firſt ſhall be of the Method of Curing, and their ſeveral Indications. The ſecond, of the Indications from Cauſes. The third, of the Indications from Diſeaſes. And the laſt, of Indications from the Strength. And ſo there ſhall remain no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept touching the cure of Diſeaſes which ſhall remain unfolded.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Method of Curing, is that part of Phyſick, whereby helps are found by Indications, to reſtore the loſt health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Curation is the change of the preſent vitious habit of the body into its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the cure of a Diſeaſe ought to be ſpeedily, ſafely, and with as much delight as may be to the Patient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Between the Method of curing and the Cure of diſeaſes there is little difference. The Method of curing being nothing but a rational way which the Phyſitian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the cure of diſeaſes. And by this method of curing which proceeds by Indication, the Dogmatical Phyſitians are diſtinguiſhed from others. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe go by Indications only, as their proper inſtruments, and the others not. Now in all cures the forementioned conditions are to be obſerved, upon which, as upon the moſt ſure foundations, the true and rational method of curing ought to lean. Therefore curation ought to proceed ſafely, if it may expel the diſeaſe, as much as can be without fear of a relapſe, doing none, or as little harm as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the patient, uſing remedies known by long cuſtome and experience. It ought to be done ſpeedily, yet not omitting any thing that ought to be done; uſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies effectual and equal to the diſeaſe, or more forcible if need require. Then it muſt be done with delight, uſing among thoſe remedies which are for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the diſeaſe, thoſe in the firſt place which are moſt gratefull to the palat, and which may be us'd with leſſe trouble to the patient: as <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches, the cure is firſt to be attempted by diet; then by Pharmaceutical remedies, before we come to iron and fire. Then that the accidents following the diſeaſe, as thirſt, pain, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, may be gently allay'd and aſſwag'd.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Indications and their differences.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>INdication is an apprehenſion of the thing helping, together with an apprehenſion of the thing hurting, which together with the thing indicating, comes without any experience or ratiocination,</hi> G. l. de opt. ſect. c. 11.</p>
                  <p>Indication is call'd by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies, a finding out, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and ſo is uſed in the method of Phyſick; ſignifying a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the remedies. For the Indications declare the nature of the things indicated, ſhewing and as it were pointing them with the finger to be uſeful for cure. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> defines Indication, 2. <hi>Metho. c.</hi> 7. an inſinuation of the form of acting; which is an explication of the word, as it were ſhadowing out the nature thereof. That is more perfect which is taken from the Theorem in the ſame <hi>Galen, l.</hi> 1. <hi>de opt. ſect.</hi> wherein <hi>Galen</hi> firſt propounds the convenient Genus; while he ſaith that it is a certain apprehenſion or notion, ingraffed into the Phyſitian and Patient by nature, out of a ſenſe of the thing ill affecting, and a deſire to expell it. Then he adds a proper difference, while he would have this notion proceed, from the known nature of the thing hurting, to the perception of the helping remedy, <hi>i.e.</hi> from the knowledge of the preternatural effect, for whoſe ſake followes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the helping remedy. Laſtly, Indication comes without experience or ratiocination, becauſe where firſt the nature of the thing affecting is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there from a certain inbred principle is judg'd the nature of the remedy: thus perceiving cold, we inquire for things that heat: we pull out a needle that is run into the fleſh, and ſuch other things we do without diſcourſe. Here it is to be obſerved, the preternatural things do not ſhew and declare thoſe remedies of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ſo they would forward their own deſtruction; but by accident, for by bringing trouble upon the Patient, they inſinuate an expulſion of themſelves, and by a certain common knowledge, the uſe of that which is contrary to them.</p>
                  <p>To this it may be objected, That if the invention of remedies conſiſt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kinde of knowledge and inbred principle, it will follow, that fools and idiots will differ nothing from skilful Artificers; and that they are as skilful in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as the Phyſitians themſelves. To which it is anſwered, that there is a very great difference, not in the firſt and moſt general Indications which conſiſt in the taking away of the thing which is preternatural, and the uſe of the contrary, for they are common to all; but in the ſpecial Indications, to perfect which it is neceſſary to know the kindes of remedies and medicinal materials, and alſo to diſtinguiſh rightly of diſeaſes, their ſymptomes and cauſes; as alſo to be experienc't in knowing, the form, quality, quantity, place, time, and manner of giving remedies, in all which Reaſon is required, and various experience among the Phyſitians. From whence we conclude, that although Indication primarily and generally, is known without reaſoning, yet ſecondarily and ſpecially it needs it very much; ſo that not a few famous Authors have referred Indication to the third operation of the minde, which is the art of ſyllogizing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Indication may be divided into four parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, one ſort of Indication, concerns preſervation, the other curing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indication that concerns preſervation, regards natural things, which are preſerved by their like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:153522:157"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indication, that concerns curation, regards preternatural things, which are taken away by their contraries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Indication is generical, ſubaltern, and ſpecifical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Generical, is that which the common general nature of the thing indicating doth afford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Subaltern, is that which the ſubalternate nature of the thing indicating ſuggeſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Specifick, which the particular nature of the thing indicating ſhewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſeries of Indications, all the practiſe of Dogmatical Phyſick conſiſts; which he that inſiſts upon, is ſaid to follow a method; proceeding from a generical Indication, by the ſubalternate, to the ſpecifical and determinate, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, 2 <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 7. <hi>He that goes about to make a method, he muſt begin from the firſt Indications, and from them to thoſe which are next, and thence to thoſe which are next to them. And he that goes forward muſt not ſtop till he come to the end; which is to finde out remedies for every diſeaſe.</hi> Examples of the method of the ſeries of Indications may be taken from all diſeaſes. For example, Suppoſe a cold diſtemper of the ſtomack in the ſecond degree, is to be cured. Firſt, here is the diſeaſe, whence proceeds the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indication that it is to be taken away. Secondly, there is the diſeaſe of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whence proceeds the ſubaltern Indication, that it is to be altered. The third is the cold diſtemper which alſo comprehends a ſubaltern Indication, that it is to be heated. And laſtly, there is a cold diſtemper in the ſecond degree, which produces the ſpecifical Indication, that the remedy muſt be heating in the ſecond degree. Beyond this Art goes not, neither does Method deſcend beneath the loweſt ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Indication is either artificial or inartificial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inartificial, is that which is commonly known to Artiſts, and to the vulgar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This inartificial Indication is the ſame with that which we have above named Generical, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, 3. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 7. <hi>Indication,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is taken from a diſeaſe, is as it were the beginning, from which the way of curing promotes it ſelf, yet no portion of the Phyſical Art it ſelf, or certainly not much nor proper to it, but which is common to the common people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artificial Indication, is that which is not known to all, but only to Artiſts, and requires great skill to finde it out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As generical Indications are inartificial, ſo ſubaltern are more artificial and much more ſpecifical, becauſe they are more difficult, and require greater skill to finde them out; and therefore proper to the method of curing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Indication is either profitable or unprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Indication is profitable which declares ſuch a remedy, whoſe matter is ſuch, as that it can of it ſelf take away the effects of the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnprofitable Indication is that which ſhews ſuch a remedy whoſe matter is not found to be ſuch, as that of it ſelf it can take away the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some preternatural effects do ſhew profitable Indications; others unprofitable. As for example, in a hot and cold diſtemper, Indication is profitable, becauſe there are many remedies that can effect the cure. But an obſtruction, that ſhewes only that it muſt be opened, affords an unprofitable Indication; becauſe there is no medicine that can of it ſelf open an obſtruction. But the opening of an obſtruction looks at other things, as inciſion, attenuation, abſterſion and evacuation of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant matter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the things that Indicate.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE thing that Indicates is a certain agent remaining in the body, which by its proper nature and eſſence declares a certain help; and that the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, as is required, ought to be directed to it, that the loſt health may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This definition comprehends only the curing Indicate, not that whoſe end is to preſerve the health, but of that which is to reſtore it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are four conditions of the thing truly indicating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it ſhould be a certain Agent, and affect the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a diſeaſe becauſe it affects the body, by deſtroying and corrupting it, is a thing that indicates, and cals for a removal of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond condition is, <hi>that the thing indicating remain in the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as it points out the removal of it ſelf, by remedies which are us'd to the body, ſo it ought to inhere in the ſame body.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>that the thing indicating, ſhould be known to the underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is explained thus: For what ever indicates, brings us into the knowledge of another thing, as of the thing indicated, or of the remedy; but that which is not known cannot inſinuate the knowledge of another thing. Therefore ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 6. and in other places, that thoſe things which act by an occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and therefore are not known to the underſtanding, are to be excluded from the method of curing, which is perfected by Indications.</p>
                  <p>The fourth condition is, <hi>that the thing indicating ſhould indicate one thing, as one thing is indicated only by one thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Axiom is delivered by <hi>Gal.</hi> 11. <hi>Meth. &amp; l. de opt. ſect.</hi> and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the Indicant alwaies declares its contrary, by which it is taken away; now there can be but one thing contrary to another: but mark the effect, that which is call'd one, is often compounded; and therefore as it is compounded it may indicate more things: or as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks 9. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 12. <hi>That which is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath a ſimple Indication; that which is not ſimple, hath not a ſimple Indication.</hi> Mark alſo, that to have one Indicant, is to be generical, ſubaltern, and ſpecifical; ſo that having a divers nature, it may indicate ſeveral things: by its Generical eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, a Generical; by its Subaltern, a Subaltern; by its Specifical, a Specifical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the true and proper Indicants are two, the Diſeaſe, and the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Indicant is a thing beſide nature, which is to be taken away by contrary remedies: But remedies are to be applied to the morbifical cauſe, and to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it ſelf. Firſt to the Cauſe, ſeeing that as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, 7. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 12. it is impoſſible that any affection ſhould be cured, the efficient cauſe remaining. But although <hi>Galen</hi> affirm, that preſervation is properly due to the cauſes; which hath made ſome to call the Cauſe, the preſerving Indicant; This is notwithſtanding to be underſtood of the avoiding of future and imminent cauſes, not of thoſe which actually produce diſeaſes in us: in the curing and taking away of which the whole force of curation lies. For no man ever cured a Feaver proceeding from putrefaction, till the putrefaction was taken away. If thou wouldſt therefore
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:153522:158"/>talk with <hi>Galen,</hi> let this be only a Preſerving cure, when the other may be term'd ſimply a Precaution in a condition healthy, or valetudinary. Curation muſt be alſo applied to the diſeaſe; for that being let alone, the diſeaſe ſtaies; and indeed ſometimes a bare diſtemper by it ſelf, without the preſence of any cauſe remains very long, as in a hectick Feaver. Then again in moſt diſeaſes the Indication which proceeds from the effects of the diſeaſe, is contrary to that which the cauſe it ſelf affords; as in a quotidian Feaver, which as to its proper nature would be refrigerated; but as to the cauſe which is flegm, requires things that heat. Moreover, from the definition of an Indicant above related, it manifeſtly appears, that thoſe are in an error, who reckon the ſtrength of the body among the true Indicants, whereas every Therapeutick Indicant, requires a taking away of it ſelf; but the ſtrength is alwaies to be preſerved; and therefore more fitly to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the Coindicants, when they are conſidered in the diſeaſe; although in a healthy eſtate, and in that part of Phyſick which is called <hi>Hygieine,</hi> the ſtrength does properly and truly indicate, becauſe all Indication conſidered in that part reſpects conſervation. Therefore in a word we may conclude, that the ſtrength of the body in the preſerving part of Phyſick, is a true Indicant; in the curing part, a Coindicant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſymptome notwithſtanding cannot be numbred among the Indicants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Indications are taken from ſupernatural things, yet they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in three things; as they contain the diſeaſe, the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and the ſymptome. Yet all Indications are taken only from the diſeaſe, and the cauſe of the diſeaſe. For the ſymptome borrows its eſſence and exiſtency ſo depending<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the diſeaſe, that the one taken away, the other preſently vaniſhes. And though there be a certain mitigation due to the Symptome, which is ſubalternate to Curation: yet that doth not happen as it is a ſymptome; but as it obtains the reaſon of the cauſe, and by its preſence may prolong or increaſe the diſeaſe. So bleeding is to be ſtopped, becauſe it may be the cauſe either of a cold diſtemper, or of death it ſelf; water is to be taken from Hydropical perſons, becauſe it increaſes the diſtemper of the Liver. So pain is to be allaied in a wound or inflamation, becauſe it increaſes the violence of the Flux, and weakens the natural ſtrength.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>COindicants, are thoſe things which do not properly ſhew the uſe of the remedy, but increaſes the efficacy of Indication, that endevours to perſwade it, or to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more eaſie.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe things are natural, or not natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To natural things are referred the ſtrength, temperament, age, ſex, cuſtome and manner of living, alſo the part affected and its ſubſtance, the temperament, action, figure, ſituation, connexion, dull or exquiſite ſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To things unnaturall are referred theſe ſix things, the air, meat and drink, motion and reſt, ſleep and watching, excrements and retentions, and the paſsions of the minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Air is referred the houſe, countrey, ſeaſon of the year, day, hour, winds, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Moon, and the various poſitions of the ſtars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:153522:159"/>
                  <p>As the true and proper Indications are taken from things preternatural, ſo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indications are fetched from things natural and not natural; becauſe though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies do not primarily indicate, yet ſecondarily they do: and without a diligent obſervation, there cannot be a right uſe of them. Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> in his Books of Method, cals thoſe things which are truly Coindicant, ſimply Indicant, though with a larger acception of the word; which is diligently to be obſerved, leſt the reading of <hi>Galen</hi> ſhould breed confuſion. Firſt therefore the true and natural indication of things natural, is conſervation: but becauſe nature cures diſeaſes, uſing remedies as inſtruments, and reduces them from power into act; therefore the ſtrength of it is to be conſidered; that by that the force of the remedy may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured at. Thus if a violent diſeaſe require a violent remedy, and that the ſtrength is in a very good condition, and can bear the force of the remedy; then the ſtrength is ſaid to condicate. So a hot temper in a hot diſeaſe coindicates cooling remedies, and contrariwiſe. But then the diſeaſe which is moſt diſtant from the natural ſtate, wants vehement remedies, but that which goes leſſe from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate, and is pretty near the nature and temper of the Patient, is to be cured with eaſier remedies.</p>
                  <p>The ſame things, Age, Sex, Cuſtome, peculiar temper and manner of living are wont to perform: which ſet forth the particular condition of the ſtrength and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament. Then after conſideration of the whole, ſome conſideration is alſo to be had of the part affected, which very powerfully coindicates in the uſe of the remedy, in obſerving the ſubſtance, temperament, figure, ſituation, connexion, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exquiſite or dull ſenſe thereof, according to which variety the uſe of the remedy is to be changed. Laſtly, things not natural coindicate, becauſe their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions change the uſe of the remedy; ſo hot air in a hot diſeaſe, coindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a cooling remedy; and ſhews it muſt be more violently applyed, then if the diſeaſe had hapned, the air being colder and more temperate; although the air coindicates more then any other thing not natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra-indicants, are thoſe which are oppoſed truly and diametrically to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name it ſelf ſhews that Contra-indicants are contrary to Indicants: now being that contraries are to be placed under the ſame Genus, and that true and primary Indicants, are things not natural; therefore Contra-indicants are alſo preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things which are oppoſed to Indicants. As when one diſeaſe is oppoſite to another, or one cauſe to another; or when the diſeaſe is oppoſite to the cauſe, or the cauſe to the diſeaſe, and points out a contrary remedy: ſo a hot diſtemper of the liver requires cooling things, to this a cold diſtemper of the ſtomack doth contraindicate, both being in the ſame individual: ſo a quotidian Feaver, of it ſelf requires cooling things, but the cauſe contra-indicates, which is a flegmatick humour, and requires hot remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Correpugnants are thoſe which are oppoſite to Coindicants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As true Indicants are ſaid to be primary Indicants, and Coindicants ſecondary Indicants: ſo true Contraindicants, are ſaid to be primary Contra-indicants; and Correpugnants are ſaid to be ſecondary Contraindicants.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Correpugnants are the ſame in kinde with Coindicants, that is, things natural, and not natural; but only as they reſiſt the remedy indicated by ſuch a diſeaſe, or the cauſe thereof, and diſſwade the uſe thereof. As when bloud-letting or purging is indicated by the Morbifick cauſe, but the ſtrength is too weak, for then the ſtrength is ſaid to be correpugnant, or to contra-indicate by a ſecondary contraindication. So alſo a putrid Feaver indicates purgation
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:153522:159"/>in the dog-daies, as to the cauſe, but the hot air reſiſts, or is correpugnant; and ſo it is to be ſaid of others. Here it is to be noted, that the name of Correpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy is ſeldom in uſe among authors, but the word Contra-indication is ſtill uſed with the addition of primary and ſecondary.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE thing Indicated is that which is ſhewn to follow from the nature of the thing indicating, that by the efficacy thereof a preternatural indiſpoſition may be taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that the thing indicated is nothing elſe but the remedy; which <hi>Gal. l. de conſtit. art. med. c.</hi> 4. ſaith to be whatever helps the body to reduce it being ill affected to its natural ſtate; for it is called by ſeveral other names both by <hi>Galen</hi> and other authors; for it is call'd, the thing profitable, the thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, remedy, ſuccour, intention, ſcope; though the word Scope is us'd alſo in another ſenſe, as when <hi>Galen</hi> ſets down the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, and the ſtrength of the body, as the ſcope of bloud-letting; for when Scope ſignifies Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and indeed the thing indicating is uſually call'd the firſt ſcope, and the thing indicated, the ſecond ſcope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The conſideration of every thing indicated, belongs to the Genus or kinde of the remedy, and the right adminiſtration thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Genus of the remedy belongs the firſt ſcope, which inquires what is to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the right adminiſtration of the remedy belong the four ſcopes, which enquire how much is to be done, in what manner, when and where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is to be done, or the Genus of the remedy is taken from the Eſſence of the thing indicating, or the thing preternatural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a cold diſeaſe indicates heating, a hot refrigeration, repletion evacuation, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the continuum, that the fleſh is to be clos'd, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>By the Genus of the remedy, we do not only underſtand the chief Genus, but alſo the ſubalternate and the ſpecifical Genus, that remedies may be found to ſatisfie the generical ſubalternate, and ſpecifical Indications which were explained in the 2. Chap. As for example, a Feaver in reſpect of its chief Genus, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural effect, cals for a remedy to remove the Feaver; in reſpect of his ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate Genus which is the preternatural heat, it indicates a cold remedy. And in reſpect of his ſpecifical Genus, which is the hot diſtemper in the ſecond degree, it intimates a cold remedy in the ſecond degree; whence it is eaſie to gather, that the quality and degrees of the remedy belong to the Genus thereof, though they are by ſome badly diſtinguiſhed, and the degree of the remedy erroneouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the quantity thereof. That is alſo to be rejected which is delivered by ſome; and indeed by <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, that the Genus of the remedy is judg'd from the name, dignity, quality, action, ſubſtance, ſituation of the part, ſtrength of the Patient, and ſuch like. For as is ſaid before, one thing is indicated but by one thing, and every thing that indicates is preternatural, but the nature of the part, action, &amp;c. are preternatural things, and therefore according to the foundation above laid, thoſe do only coindicate, or are correpugnant; and that we may bring
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:153522:160"/>the minde of <hi>Galen</hi> to an exact rule, we muſt ſay that he names coindicating things there not as true and proper indicating things, but as things indicating ſecondarily, for which reaſon they are diligently to be obſerved, as mainly conducing to curation. So the liver, heart, and other parts which are more excellent, do not bear vehement remedies, and reſiſt the uſe of them; ſo thoſe parts which are of a cold nature, while they labour with a hot affection, deſire remedies that cool very much, when in the ſame affection they recede farther from the natural temper then thoſe things which are hot. In the ſame manner thoſe things which are endu'd with an exquiſite ſenſe, ſuſtain not ſuch painful medicines as the affection requires; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe diſeaſes which are deep in the body and far from the external ſuperficies, require ſtronger remedies, then the affection it ſelf naturally requires, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts do not admit ſuch things as have either a corroding or venemous quality, which their affections do require, though the externall parts can bear them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How much is to be done, ſignifies the quantity or doſe of the remedy, which is judged by the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, or by the depravement of the natural habit, more or leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The quantity of the remedy alſo is taken for the degree and vehemency of the remedy; but with thoſe that are more exact the whole doſe is only referred to the quantity, when the degree is referred to the Genus of the remedy, as is ſaid in the former Theorem. But as the diſeaſe recedes more or leſſe from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate of the body, a greater or leſſe doſe is to be exhibited, for in a greater quantity there is a greater quality; and ſo in a greater exceſſe, a greater doſe is to be preſcribed, that it may exceed the diſeaſe. Things alſo indicating in a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, conduce much to determine the quantity of the remedy, which do not truly indicate, but coindicate, and are repugnant. So the natural temper of the part indicates the quantity of the remedy, according to the exceſſe of the diſtemper: ſo the parts which are ſeated within the body, require a greater doſe of phyſick, that the faculty thereof may be the more eaſily carried to the part affected; ſo an Eryſipelas in the thumb requires a greater doſe of Oxycratium, then one in the thigh or arm; ſo an inflamation of many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, requires a greater quantity of cooling phyſick, which may ſuffice to allay the heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In what manner, or the way of applying remedies, ſignifies nothing elſe but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe remedies are to be applied once or twice, ſeldom or often; now this is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the manner of the preternatural affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when a diſeaſe afflicts continually and vehemently, medicines are to be applied ſuddenly and faſt. If the cauſe of the diſeaſe ſwell, and there be an Orgaſmus, if the matter be fluid and apt to run, if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, then it requires a ſudden evacuation; but if it flowes ſlowly and by intervals, and threatens rather a long continuance through crudity then any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; then with things that alter and purge, the matter is to be altered and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To indicate the manner of uſing, the ſecondary Indicants do not a little conduce, as far as they do coindicate, or are correpugnant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſtrength of nature eaſily aſſents to a ſtrong remedy; but a weak habit muſt have gentle mutations, by intervals; ſo the thin and ſoft ſubſtance of the parts, or which hath a more exquiſite ſenſe, cannot ſo well endure the force of a violent remedy, as the ſolid, thick, and leſſe ſenſible. Alſo a remote ſituation of the parts requires the remedy ſhould be uſed often, that it may at length penetrate to the part,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:153522:160"/>without any prejudice to parts that lie between. In a noble part alſo a man muſt proceed warily, and by degrees, leſt by the ſudden alteration of the part, the body ſhould ſuſtain greater harm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When it is to be done, is the convenient time and fit occaſion for the adminiſtration of remedies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is double, general or particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The general time is one of the four times of the diſeaſe, the beginning, increaſing, height, and declination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Gal. l. de opt. ſect. c.</hi> 37. teaches at what time cold water is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, whether in the beginning, increaſe, height, or declination. So in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of inflamations, the practicks teach us, that in the beginning, repelling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are to be applied; in the increaſe, reſolving joyned with repelling; and ſo of the reſt.</p>

                     <hi>The particular time for adminiſtring a remedy, is the ſecond hour of the day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſame place teaches, in what day and at what hour of the day cold water is to be uſed: ſo a purging medicine is to be uſed the ſixth day, or ſome ſuch like in the morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnder the time is reduc'd, the order of the remedies, though ſome erroneouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh order from time, and ſo constitute another ſcope in reſpect of that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a ſimple or compounded affection, if more remedies are to be us'd, as it moſt commonly happens; we muſt obſerve at what time every one is to be us'd; and this regards order; as for example, In reſpect of the Feaver, cold water is to be drank; in reſpect of the cauſe, a vein is to be opened. Now while there is a fit time to be preſcribed for both theſe, the order is alſo conſtituted, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in performing them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The time, occaſion, and order of remedies, is indicated by the preſence of the moſt urgent Indicant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When and as often as the diſeaſe requires, we muſt alwaies endevour againſt it; and therefore the preſence of the diſeaſe or the morbifical cauſe, ſhewes the time and occaſion of applying remedies; but when more do urge at once, we muſt reſiſt the moſt violent. But in the uſurpation of theſe there is alwaies a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to be had of the Coindicants, and Contra-indicants. For though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the affection perſwades the uſing of a remedy, yet the ſtrength and nature of every particular patient, may prohibit ſomething or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where it is to be done, ſhewes in what place, and through what place the remedies are to be adminiſtred, and is indicated by the place of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the diſeaſe or the cauſe of the diſeaſe poſſeſſe the whole body, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt be uſed to the whole body; if it oppreſſe only one part, remedies muſt be applyed to that part only; if the external parts be affected, the remedies muſt be applied outward, if the internal parts be affected, they are to be taken inward; and if the remedy reach both waies to the part affected, it may be us'd both waies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſhew the place alſo of the remedy the Coindicants do not a little conduce, and eſpecially the forming of the parts, the ſituation and connexion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Ventricle is purged by vomit and ſtool, the hollow part of the Liver by dejection or looſneſſe, the convex part by provocation of urine chiefly. To the guis we apply remedies through the fundament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the ſame manner Correpugnants are to be conſidered, which prohibit the uſe of the remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:153522:161"/>
                  <p>For example, the inflamed orifice of the ſtomack might be externally refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the nearneſſe of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> did not hinder it; and ſo alſo the outward calefaction of it, when it is cool'd, is hindered by the lappet of the Liver which lies upon it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the firſt and moſt general principle of Curation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ALL methods of curing, are taken from this firſt and moſt general principle,</hi> Contraries are cured by contraries.</p>
                  <p>Although there is no diſputing of principles, they being to be granted for true and unqueſtionable, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches of this <hi>principle of Curation:</hi> that in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick 'tis as certain that contraries are cured by contraries, as in Mathematicks, that twice two are four; and that this principle is not only bred in men by nature, but alſo in beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are ſome objections which at firſt ſight do ſeem to queſtion the truth thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Tetanus</hi> is a cold diſeaſe, yet is cured by cold water; pain, is eas'd by pain; vomit, by vomit; looſneſſe, by looſneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All contraries are made more intenſe by the approach of contraries; as if a man put his hand to the fire when it is num'd with cold, it is more tormented; alſo if a man put his burnt finger into cold water, it torments him more then if he ſhould hold it to the fire, or dip it in Aqua vitae.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Purging medicines are proper remedies againſt peccant humours, yet they purge thoſe humours by a familiarity, not a contrariety which they have with thoſe humours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nature uſeth to cure both hot and cold diſeaſes, with which it can be at no contrariety.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Diſeaſes have no contrariety of number, magnitude, or figure, by which they may be taken away.</p>
                  <p>To ſatisfie theſe Objections, we muſt ſay that the word Contrariety hath a larger ſignification with the Phyſitians then with the Philoſophers; being not only with them conſidered as to the form, but as to the effect and operation.</p>
                  <p>For what ever can remove a thing which is beſides nature, or induce a contrary effect, whether it be by it ſelf or by accident, is named contrary. So Rhubarb is contrary to choler, as it purges it forth; ſo Iron and fire is contrary to ſuperfluous fleſh, becauſe it takes it away; which being thus premiſed, it will be eaſie to anſwer theſe objections.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt we ſay that the Tetane is cured by the effuſion of cold water by accident, the heat being increaſed by Antiperiſtaſis in the interior parts; pain is taken away accidentally by pain, while the new pain draws to it ſelf the cauſe of the new pain; vomit is cured by vomit, looſneſſe by looſneſſe, the cauſe being eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated which occaſioned them.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond we ſay, That the contention of contraries is troubleſome to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if it be ſudden and vehement, but if it be moderate and convenient, it is very agreeable; ſo the hand benumm'd with cold, being held to the fire, is tormented, becauſe there is too ſudden a contention of contraries; but being put into luke-warm
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:153522:161"/>water, or wrapp'd in warm linnen, it come to it ſelf: ſo the finger being burnt, and held to the fire, or dipp'd in Aqua vitae is eas'd, in reſpect of the cauſe, for the hot things draw forth the fire fixed in the part which the water drave far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in.</p>
                  <p>To the third I anſwer, That though purging remedies are of a familiar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the peccant humours, yet they may effectively be ſaid to be contrary, becauſe they purge them and draw them out of the body.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth I anſwer, That nature is contrary to all diſeaſes, by reaſon that it concocts and expels the cauſe of them.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth we ſay, That thoſe things are effectively contrary to number, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and figure, which do take away or alter them, as iron, fire, ligatures, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe contraries as much as may be, ought to be equal among themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That equality is indicated from the nature of the diſeaſe and the morbifical cauſe, which indicate a ſudden removal thereof. But the ſtrength, part affected, and time of the diſeaſe, and other circumſtances, are equally repugnant to them. Therefore in the Theorem is added this particle, <hi>as much as may be;</hi> becauſe the equality of contraries is not abſolutely neceſſary to curation, but only to the more commodious curation, if the reſt agree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The equality of the remedy in reſpect of the diſeaſe, is doubly conſidered; either according to the degree, copiouſneſſe, or magnitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An equal remedy as to the degree, is that which hath the ſame receſſe from the mean as the diſeaſe. Thus a cold remedy in the ſecond degree is equal to a diſeaſe hot in the ſecond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An equal remedy according to the magnitude and copiouſneſſe, is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the degree of its quantity being exhibited, once, twice or more times, may purge out the diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe a moderate and vehement remedy may be ſaid to obtain an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt any diſeaſe; when as being vehement, once or twice taken, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, oftner uſed, it avails to remove the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, equality in degree, is ſo either actually and really, or elſe in reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the operation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus in ſimilar diſeaſes, there is granted a degree of contrariety exiſting in act, as a hot remedy in the ſecond degree us'd to a cold diſeaſe in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But in diſeaſes as to the form of the part, magnitude, or number, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are ſaid to be equall according to the operation which they make appear, in reſtoring the form, magnitude, or number of parts.</p>
                  <p>By that which we have above ſaid, may all the objections be eaſily reſolved, which wont to be brought againſt the contrariety of qualities, of which the chief are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hipp.</hi> 6. <hi>Epid.</hi> ſaith contraries muſt be uſed by degrees, and with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Galen</hi> forbids efficacious and violent remedies at the beginning, commanding us to begin with the weakeſt at firſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The efficacy of cold is leſſe then that of heat; the efficacy of moiſture leſſe then that of drought, and therefore are not to be oppoſed in an equal degree.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To hot and cold diſeaſes in the fourth degrees, muſt not be exhibited remedies hot and cold in the fourth degree, for they are poyſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If all diſeaſes were cured by equal contraries, the proportion of the agent ſhould be equall in all things to that which ſuffers, and ſo the ſame ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:153522:162"/>of alteration, and ſo all ſick people would be cured in the ſame time.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Reduction according to <hi>Galen</hi> ought to be made in ſound bodies by equall contraries; and in ſick perſons, thoſe which are moſt ſtrong ought to be uſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſeaſe ought ſooner to be removed then the natural temper.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Paulus</hi> at the beginning of <hi>l.</hi> 4. Rightly ſaith he in my opinion hath <hi>Aretaeus</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> delivered to memory, that the forces of the diſeaſes ought to be ſtronger then the diſeaſes, and that therefore Leproſie is never cured, becauſe there is no Phyſick ſtrong enough againſt it.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt we ſay that <hi>Hipp.</hi> exhibits contraries by degrees; and <hi>Galen</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes us to begin with weak things, in regard of the circumſtances, leſt the ſtrength ſhould be impaired; or in regard of the Contra-indicants, leſt the crude matter ſhould be agitated in vain, the diſeaſe it ſelf perhaps requiring equall things.</p>
                  <p>To the third we ſay, That though the force of cold be leſſe then that of heat, and that of moiſture more then that of drought, yet becauſe we regard equality in the laſt limit of the action, therefore they ſhall not be accounted leſſe equal, if they can reduce the exceſſe of the diſeaſe to a moderation.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth I anſwer, That poyſons are alſo us'd in Phyſick, if the nature of the diſeaſe require, and that they be rightly prepared.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth I anſwer, That the time of cure is not equal in all diſeaſes, becauſe it is not lawful in all diſeaſes to uſe equal contraries, by reaſon of the various diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſubject and circumſtances; and though the uſe of them ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſpeedineſſe of cure is not requiſite in all diſeaſes, by reaſon of the great variety of accidents more in one diſeaſe then in another.</p>
                  <p>To the ſixth we ſay, That though reduction ought to be made by equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, yet they work not with the ſame efficacy as in the cure of a diſeaſe; which being in the diſpoſition, is more equally remov'd by contrary equals, then the temperament, which is in the habit, and therefore more hardly corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to the authority of <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aretaeus</hi> we ſay, That remedies equal to the diſeaſe in regard of the intention, are more ſtrong in regard of the effect, for nature helps them and fights with them againſt the diſeaſe.</p>

                     <hi>REmedies fit for the cure of the diſeaſe are found out by a threefold way: by Reaſon, Experience, and Collection of likelihoods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Reaſon remedies are invented through indications, when the diſeaſe and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe is known to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we ſay that a Feaver indicates things that are refrigerate, becauſe we know the nature of it to be hot and hurtful to us, which requires things contrary, and a removal thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Experience Remedies are found out, when by many examples it is obſerved, that ſome remedies are good againſt ſome diſeaſes, though the cauſe of that effect be not known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> writes that Phyſick leans upon two pillars, Reaſon and Experience,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:153522:162"/>which is not to be underſtood of that rude experience which Empiricks and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people uſe ſo raſhly in all diſeaſes; but that only which concerns thoſe diſeaſes and thoſe remedies whoſe nature and cauſe is unknown; as Antidotes againſt poyſon and venomous diſeaſes, are known by experience, but without reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Collection of likelihoods, remedies are found out when ſuch remedies are applied to an unknown diſeaſe, as cure diſeaſes of the like nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the <hi>French</hi> diſeaſe, when it firſt began and was unknown, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which were uſed in Leproſies and foul ſcabs, were not unfitly uſed for that alſo.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>REvulſion, is an averting of the humour flowing into any part, to the oppoſite and moſt diſtant parts; having a regard to the original of the flux, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and good condition of the veſſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Evacuation of the humour regards it either as it is in motion, or in reſt.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:153522:163"/>To the humour moving or flowing into any part, revulſion and derivation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; to the humour reſting, evacuation. Revulſion ought to be made in the remoteſt place from that part troubled with the flux, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches, 13. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Glaucon. c.</hi> 2. and the nature of Revulſion it ſelf ſhews as much; for we endevour that that which is drawn back, may not return; which end is more eaſily attained, if revulſion be made to the moſt oppoſite and remote parts. Yet this is not ſimply and abſolutely to be underſtood, but with conditions ſuppoſed, which ſhall be ſet down in the following Theorems.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The oppoſition or contrariety of the parts required in Revulſion, hath three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt condition is that revulſion be made to the original of the flux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As often as the original of the flux is known, Revulſion is alwaies to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to it, and the humours, and to be drawn back to it again. As for example, if the Flux be from the liver to the womb, the vein of the right arm is to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the humour may be reduc'd to the ſource and original of the Flux.</p>
                  <p>The ſentence of <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to contradict this condition, in his book of curing by Bloud-letting, <hi>l.</hi> 6. where he would in an inflamation of the womb, that the thigh ſhould be let bloud. To which we anſwer, that the lower veins are to be cut in an inflamation of the womb not as to ſimple revulſion, in which caſe it would be better to let bloud in the ſuperior parts, but for derivation alſo as well as revulſion. By which anſwer other places of <hi>Galen</hi> are made plain, where he teaches, that the parts below the reins being affected, that it is better to cut the lower veins, that derivation and revulſion may be both made together, when otherwiſe as to ſimple revulſion, in thoſe affections the upper veins only uſe to be opened.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond condition is, <hi>that the communion of the veſſels be regarded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the original of the Flux be known, it is enough to obſerve the firſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the flux be drawn back to the part from whence it flowes. But when that part is not known, then the two latter conditions are to be obſerved which concern the part receiving, that the communion of the veſſels and the right habit of the parts be obſerved. Thoſe veſſels are ſaid to have a communion which have a relation to the part affected. So in a flux of bloud from the noſe, the veins in the arm are open, and not in the thigh; though theſe are more diſtant from the part receiving, becauſe they have a leſſer relation to the part. So <hi>Galen</hi> in 13. <hi>Meth.</hi> in a flegment of the liver, cuts the inner vein of the arm, becauſe it keeps correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the liver by a large and broad way. So alſo <hi>l. de tremor.</hi> If, ſaith he, you cut the veins which have no agreement with the part affected, you do that part no good, and hurt the ſound part by drawing from it that bloud which it may want.</p>
                  <p>The third condition is, <hi>to obſerve the right direction of the veſſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This condition is of moſt moment and chiefly to be obſerved in all revulſions: for it is founded upon the neer conſent and relation which the parts of the ſame ſide have one to another, which is confirm'd by many experiments. The right ſide of the womb is ſo much hotter then the left, that thereby the right ſide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth males, the left females. The cauſe of this increaſe of heat is the directneſſe of the liver to that part; for the vicinity and community of the veſſels are not alike to both parts. A Palſie poſſeſſes an exact half of the body, the other unhurt, and yet the humour fals down from the third and fourth ventricle of the brain, in which there is no ſeparation of the right from the left. So the liver being inflamed, if bloud break forth from the right noſtril, it cures it; if from the left only it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:153522:164"/>avails not; there being but one vein which comes from the liver to each noſtril. If the left arm be open, the ſpleen is evacuated, and the left ſide, which would not ſo fall out from the right arm. Yet the left, if you look at the communion of the veins, draws not from the right, but by the intervening of the the liver. And laſtly, 6. <hi>Epid. Hip.</hi> ſaith that the permutations of diſeaſes, Criſis and Apoſtems are made directly, and in a ſtraight line.</p>
                  <p>But why the direction of the veſſels ſhould avail ſo much, is hard to ſay, though there are many opinions, among which to let go the reſt, the moſt probable is that which hath been confirm'd by certain very grave Authors; that there are many channels that run through the whole length of the body, by which there is a free paſſage upwards and downwards of every thing contain'd in the body; which notwithſtanding are not diſtributed through the ſides. But thoſe channels, becauſe they are not conſpicuous to the ſenſe, are confirmed by two reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the above mentioned experiments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the end, ſeeing that nature being ſolicitous for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of individuals, conſtitutes them as it were of two parts, that ſo the one ſuffering any miſchance, the other may remain whole. Thus when by any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune one eye, ear or arm periſhes, by the other eye, ear or arm, life is preſerved; and ſo as it were two living creatures, the right and left being joyned into one, ſhe hath made their life more laſting.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the event. For an alteration is made ſuddenly from the right foot to the right arm or ſhoulder, and contrary; as alſo the right part of the head being affected, and the humour deſcending, the right part of the neck ſwels ſooneſt, ſo the humour ſtaies there; or if it deſcend to the breaſt, the right fide is repleted ſooner then the left: or laſtly, if the humour deſcend to the inferiour parts, it cauſes the gout in the right ſide ſooner then in the left. By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the foot being afflicted in an Epilepſie, ſome matter aſcends to the head, which could not be, unleſſe thoſe channels were granted, which as they are hidden in dead men, ſo are they manifeſt in thoſe that live, and through thoſe the humours are carried ſtraight forward, aſcending or deſcending finde an eaſie way, if they be drawn, expell'd, or any other way mov'd up and down by the force of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                  <p>By what we have ſaid before, the opinion of the <hi>Arabians</hi> is eaſily confuted, who make revulſions without obſerving that directneſſe of the veſſels to any terms of contrariety; of which they make three ſorts, from the upper parts to the lower, from the fore parts to the hinder, from the right to the left. Whence <hi>Avicen fen.</hi> 10. <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> 3. <hi>tract.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1. in a Pleureſie and other internal inflamations, firſt cauſes a vein to be opened in the ankle of the ſame ſide: ſecondly, the common vein in arm of the contrary ſide: and laſtly, the inner vein of the ſame ſide. Which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is manifeſtly contrary to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the true method of curing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this alſo the <hi>Arabians</hi> are defective in numbring the Diameters or quarters of the body, when as they conſtitute only three; for they ſhould have joyn'd a fourth, that is from internal to external: which <hi>Galen</hi> propoſes in his Book of Revulſion; and that is obſerved in a Pleureſie, when a vein is cut in the ſame ſide; for then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion is made from the interior parts to the exterior.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revulſion is double, Vniverſal and Particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vniverſal, is that which obſerves the whole body, and in that reſpects the contrary terms whence the humours flow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is chiefly performed when the greater veins are cut, and the Liver as the original of the fluxions is exhauſted; and is therefore the moſt uſeful and moſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:153522:164"/>ſecure; that when the original of the flux is not known, that Revulſion be performed by the greater veins through the liver, for ſo the veins being emptied, they retain the reſt of the bloud, and will not permit it to flow: whence <hi>Galen</hi> firſt <hi>ad Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi> 14. would have the flux of inflamations drawn back either from, either to the common veſſel, or to the original of the flux. So 2. <hi>Acut. c.</hi> 10. <hi>What ever vein is opened it empties the whole, becauſe there is but one conflux and paſſage of all things in the body.</hi> But with this difference, that ſome veins exhauſt ſome parts ſooner then others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Particular Revulſion which is alſo called local, is that which in one member only reſpects the contrary terms and bound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is obſerved in the opening of leſſe veins, which draw only from one part, and ſimply deſerves not the name of Revulſion, and is properly to be referred to der vation, and therefore only retaining the name of Revulſion, that theſe precepts may be conſentaneous with the doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> who cals derivations of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the name of Revulſion. For explaining the 68. Aphor. of <hi>Hipp.</hi> ſect. 5. who ſo writes, <hi>The hinder part of the head being affected, a vein is to be cut in the forchead;</hi> he ſaith that Revulſion ought to be according to longitude upward and downward, according to latitude in the right and left hand, according to depth from the foreparts to the hinder; and that therefore the hinder part of the head being affected, Revulſion ought to be made by cutting a vein in the forehead; which is particular and local. Revulſion and in a plethorick body ought not to be uſed but after univerſal Revulſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Derivation is an averting of the humour flowing to any part through the near parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe Derivation is like particular Revulſion, therefore from the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the foregoing Theorem, the nature of Derivation is made plain enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Derivation, the communion of the veſſels is perpetually to be obſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Derivation in this differs from Revulſion, becauſe that is made to the oppoſite and diſtant parts, this to the near part; ſo in a fluxion that fals down to the teeth and eyes, a veſicatory is applied behinde the eyes for derivation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Particular Evacuation, is that which evacuates the humour out of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this is to be done after Revulſion and Derivation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The manner of it is twofold, Senſible or Inſenſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Senſible, is performed either by the paſſages made by nature for that purpoſe, or by Iron, and Cauſticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Brain is evacuated through the noſtrils and Palat, the Bladder through the Ureter, the Lungs through the rough Artery, the Bladder through the Ureter, that is to ſay, through natural channels. But the matter of Apoſtems and things of that nature contained in a part which wanteth channels, we draw forth by artificial opening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inſenſibly, it is performed through the pores and inſenſible paſſages of the parts; and this is properly called Reſolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the matter contained in any part, breeding ſwellings and ſuch like affections, is reſolved by fomentations, oyntments, plaiſters, and ſuch like remedies, without any manifeſt evacuation.</p>
                  <p>In the right adminiſtration of Revulſion, Derivation, and particular Evacuation, the following Theorems are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:153522:165"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When a flux urges very much, revulſion is to be uſed; but when it is almoſt ſpent, derivation, then when the flux fals down no more but that the humour is fixed in one place, particular evacuation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the matter that flows is venomous, it is not to be drawn back; but from the beginning to be vacuated through the part receiving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in Carbuncles, malign Scabs, ſmall Pox, peſtilent and pockie Bubo's. It is not lawful to cut a vein for revulſion, but only for ſimple evacuation, if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be very Plethorick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revulſion, Derivation, and particular Evacuation may be performed altogether at one and the ſame time with one and the ſame evacuation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although Revulſion, Derivation, and particular evacuation ſeem in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contrary; one being to be done to the diſtant, the other two to the near parts; yet there may be many evacuations partaking of them all together. If the middle diſtance, between the near and moſt remote part; as in a Pleureſie, when a vein in the arm is opened, that which flowes is drawn back, that which is near to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is deriv'd, and that which is fixed in the narrow paſſages of the part is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated. But theſe evacuations made together and at once are moſt profitable, as may be collected out of a precept of <hi>Galen</hi> not known to the common Phyſicians. 6. <hi>Epid. ſect.</hi> 2. where he teaches, that a man muſt not inſiſt upon revulſories all the time of the flux, but the middle time is to be interpoſed for the vacuation of the humour contained in the part. For ſo at length the flux will ceaſe, if the flowing matter be averted by diſtant revulſions, and that by near evacuations the pain and heat of the part be taken away, which are the cauſes of the flux. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the humour flowing, it be granted that by a moderately remote ſection of a vein, a man may both avert and evacuate, no doubt but that is to be embraced. Which <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves in an inflamation of the liver, and in other caſes; as alſo is uſually done in a Pleureſie, as we have ſhewed above. Laſtly, out of <hi>Galen</hi> 13. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 10. <hi>If a flux only is to be cured, the most diſtant part is to be cut; if a repletion, the neareſt part.</hi> Hence it appears, that where they are both joyned together, there a moderate diſtance is to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when Revulſion and Derivation are performed both at once from one vein, that moderation is to be uſed, that the vacuation be not little, which being only agitated increaſes the flux, rather then allay it by extraction of the humour: and care muſt be taken, that the ſame day, if nature ſuffer, or at fartheſt, the next day, that the ſame vein be opened again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a moſt uſeful precept and of great moment in Phyſick, though many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not to the great dammage of their patients; for if at firſt the bloud be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly let out, and not in a ſufficient quantity, it runs more vehemently into the part. Then it being not lawful to exhauſt the whole at the firſt ſection, but only as to the change of colour, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and that the ſtrength will not bear a greater, it remains that what the firſt ſection only left the ſecond ſhould take away. And whereas the place affected being emptied, it ſucks bloud from the near places and vitiates it, unleſſe it be taken away by the benefit of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond evacuation, it is unavoidable that it ſhould putrefie and breed a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The quantity of Revulſion and Derivation ought to anſwer the quantity of the flux if the ſtrength can bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when the flux is great, if derivation and revulſion is to be performed by bloud-letting; the bloud muſt be taken away in that quantity that it may exhauſt all the matter of the flux, regard being had to the ſtrength, that they are able to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:153522:165"/>bear a total evacuation. And here we may take notice of that notorious precept of <hi>Hipp.</hi> 2. <hi>de vict. rat. in acu. text</hi> 10. where he teaches the manner and limit of bleeding in inflamations, eſpecially in Pleureſies, that is to the alteration of colour. For that change of colour ſhewes that the bloud comes from the very part affected, as <hi>Galen</hi> teaches in his comment. on theſe words: <hi>Whatever bloud,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is contained in fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone, that changes colour through the abundance of heat, but the reſt remains alike in all parts. For that cauſe the bloud which is diffuſed through the whole body being more fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, will be more ruddie in that ſide which is oppreſſed with the flegmone. But if the bloud which is diffuſed through the whole body, be more ruddy, it would be more aduſt and blackiſh in the ſide poſſeſſed with the flegmone.</hi> Therefore change of colour certainly ſignifies a tranſlation of the bloud from the part affected. But a man muſt not alwaies expect it, as <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves there, by reaſon of the failing of the ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>While the humour flowes violently, the greater veins are to be opened, ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place and ſituation of the parts permit it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe a quick and ſudden Revulſion is made through the greater veins, and for the moſt part Derivation alſo, which may reſiſt the celerity of the flux.</p>

                  <p>This Theorem includes a very great Controverſie concerning the indications of bloud-letting, which hath variouſly troubled the wits of Authors, and entangled them in many difficulties: From which that we may the more eaſily diſingage our ſelves, we ſhall follow the principles laid in the former Section; where the nature of things indicating and things indicated is rightly ſtated, and they exactly diſtinguiſhed from Coindicants and Correpugants.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore it is to be ſuppoſed, that we do here take bloud-letting for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of evacuation, and a remedy to evacuate the bloud. Which being granted, we ſay that bloud-letting is indicated only by a Plethora or fulneſſe, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a redundancy of bloud, when as but one thing can be indicated by one thing, and the thing indicated ought to be contrary to the thing indicating: but to plenty of bloud the diminution thereof is directly oppoſed, which <hi>Galen</hi> acknowledges, while he teaches that bloud-letting is indicated by the multitude of bloud, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtrength, and youthful age. But when <hi>l. de ven. ſect.</hi> and in many other places he ſets down ſimply the foreſaid indications of bloud-letting, that is the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, the good condition of the ſtrength, and vigorous age, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them to plenitude, he doth not give them properly and ſtrictly the name of Indications, as from that which followes ſhall appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One thing is only indicated by one thing, as hath been ſhewed <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. therefore bloud-letting cannot be indicated by three things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Strength and age when they are referred to natural things, never can truly indicate, but only coindicate, as is above demonſtrated <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, the law of contrariety-being obſerved, which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:153522:166"/>ought to intercede between the indicant and the thing indicated, cannot indicate any thing but the greatneſſe of the remedy. And ſo purging being as great a remedy as bloud-letting, they are both equally indicated by a great diſeaſe, but not bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting particularly. Which <hi>Galen</hi> ſeeing, 4. <hi>Meth.</hi> ſaith the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe indicates now purgation, now bloud-letting; by which is ſhewn, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a diſeaſe is not a true indicant of bloud-letting, becauſe it is not one thing, nor perpetual.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the ſame law of contrariety, when bloud-letting is a kinde of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that there ought a contrariety to intercede between a great diſeaſe and evacuation, but there being no contrariety, one thing cannot be indicated by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Neither will it ſuffice to ſay they are contraries by accident, for true indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants ought to indicate of themſelves a contrary remedy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are many great diſeaſes, for which bloud-letting is not convenient; as a Hectick Feaver, and whatever are caus'd by emptineſſe, and therefore the magnitude of a diſeaſe is no true Indicant of bloud-letting.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ſay that <hi>Galen</hi> makes the magnitude of a diſeaſe to indicate bloud-letting, not that it properly and truly does ſo, which ſome late writers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to defend, but that it is a ſign which ſhewes a vehement diſtemper in the bloud, as often as the diſeaſe proceeds from thence, and that viciouſneſſe of the bloud requires bloud-letting. Strength and age coindicate only, and are ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate through a large acception of the word, as we have ſhewed above, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indicants are often by <hi>Galen</hi> termed Indicants. The magnitude of the diſeaſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates bloud-letting, conditionally that there is no other remedy through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud, for elſe the Plethora being abſent, the diſeaſe might be cured other waies, as by faſting, exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Plethora, is either as to the Veſſels or the Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Plethora as to the Veſſels, is cauſed either when all the humours are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and is ſimply called a Plethora; or elſe when the bloud only redounds ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly, and is called a Plethora of bloud: when another humour exceeds the bloud in quantity, and exceeds alſo all the other humours, they alſo abounding above their juſt meaſure, it is called a Plethora of that humour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, when one humour exceeds all the reſt, they being equally poys'd, it is called a Cacochymia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cacochymia, is a vice in the quality, as the other is in the quantity; for bloud may be increaſed without a vice in the quality, though not other humours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plethora as to the Strength, is that which though it do not fill the veſſels extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, yet it oppreſſes the faculties of the body, eſpecially the natural, ſo that when it cannot be rul'd by them it degenerates into corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again of Plethora's, ſome are light, ſome heavie, ſome preſent, ſome future, ſame common, ſome proper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bloud-letting, is alſo convenient for Revulſion, Derivation, and to cool the whole body, not of it ſelf but by accident.</p>
                  <p>Bloud-letting of it ſelf drawes out a multitude of humours contained in the veins, but by accident it makes a revulſion, and derivation of the humours flowing to ſome part. It refrigerates alſo the body by accident, by drawing forth part of the hot humour, and giving a free tranſpiration to that which is left.</p>
                  <p>From the foreſaid Theorems may be eaſily gathered the ſolutions of all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are brought by many to prove that bloud-letting is not indicated by a Plethora. For in thoſe who have fallen from a high place, though there be no
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:153522:166"/>manifeſt Plethora preſent, yet they breath a vein becauſe there is a Plethora as to the ſtrength, for they being weakned by the fall, cannot rule the humours which before nature kept well in order while the party was in health; therefore is that bloud-letting, for revulſion of the humours that began to flow to the bruiſed parts. So in an immoderate flux of the bloud, breathing a vein is commended, not as it is an evacuation, but as it is a revulſory medicine. So in putrid Feavers, a vein is opened to cool the body, or becauſe there is a Plethora as to the ſtrength. For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being delivered from part of the burthen by which ſhe was oppreſſed, the more eaſily ſuſtains and tames with leſſe difficulty that which is behinde. Laſtly, a light Plethora which may be cured by exerciſe, wants not bloud-letting; but that only which is more heavy, and produces, or ſhortly will produce ſome great diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Among thoſe things which vindicate bloud-letting, the ſtrength of the body ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the firſt place, which if it be firm and luſty, doth well permit it, but if it be faint and languid, will not allow thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Strength is comprehended under a threefold number of the faculties, but eſpecially in the vital faculty; for if from a big and equal pulſe, and free brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it appear undiminiſhed and luſty, it permits bloud-letting; but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it appear weak and faint by the pulſe and manner of breathing, it diſſwades bloud-letting. Though the morbifick cauſe or the diſeaſe it ſelf do require this kinde of remedy: or at moſt perſwades it to be done ſparingly, and at at ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals. But the faint ſtrength is diligently to be diſtinguiſhed from the oppreſſed ſtrength. The ſtrength is oppreſſed by internal cauſes, as obſtruction, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of humour, and then they are relieved by evacuation. They are diſſolved and diſſipated by moſt evident cauſes, as by the heat and malignant corruption. of the air, by labour, watching, famine, or any immoderate vacuation, fierceneſſe of pain, violence of the diſeaſe, and diuturnity likewiſe, and other ſuch like; and then refreſhing and renewing is rather to be uſed then evacuation. When the ſtrength is faint and oppreſſed, the pulſe is equall, but with this difference, for at the beginning of a diſeaſe when the ſtrength is oppreſſed, the pulſe is perceived to be little and almoſt buried, but when they are faint and languiſhing in the increaſe and vigor of the diſeaſe, with which the formentioned cauſes concur.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A vigorous age coindicates alſo bloud-letting. Which is in the middle between youth and old age, but childhood and old age allow not of it but in caſes of urgent neceſsity, and that with extreme caution uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Age neither coindicates nor is correpugnant, unleſſe in reſpect of the ſtrength, which in a childe and old man are ſo weak, that they can hardly ſuſtain bloud let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For children have a ſoft, tender, and open body, which of it ſelf is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſted and diſſolved. And as for old men they want ſpirits and heat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hip.</hi> 4. <hi>de vict. rat. in morb. acut.</hi> teaches that a vigorous age where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is great, and the ſtrength not impaired, requires bloud-letting: whhom <hi>Galen</hi> following, 21. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. de cur. rat. per vew. ſect.</hi> forbids to let bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 14. year, and after the 70. which is to be underſtood of that more full eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation uſed by the ancients; for a moderate bloud-letting which is but equall or inferior to the ſtrength and fulneſſe of humour overy age can beat, if it be vigorous and luſty; for age is not to be meaſured by number of years, but by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrength and habit of body. Which <hi>Celſus</hi> elegantly confirms <abbr>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:153522:167"/>would prove abortive. But experience afterward ſhew'd that there was no certainty in theſe things, and that there are other better obſervations by which the Phyſitian may inform his judgement. For it matters not what the age be, nor what is born in the body, but what the ſtrength is; and therefore a ſtrong childe, a luſty old man, and a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy woman with childe, are ſafely cured.</hi> So <hi>Rhaſis</hi> in a decrepit old age oppreſſed with a violent Pleureſie let bloud: and <hi>Avenzour</hi> opened a vein in his childe not above three years old, and that with ſucceſſe. And daily we ſee that children of four or five years of age are recovered from dangerous diſeaſes by bloud-letting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The quantity of bloud to be let, is judged by the greatneſſe of the vice in the bloud; and ſo a great diſeaſe indicates the letting of much bloud, a moderate diſeaſe moderate bleeding, a little one little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The quantity the ſtrength of the patient coindicates, which if they are luſty, then he may ſafely bleed as much as the diſeaſe requires; if weak, leſſe; if very weak, not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a great diſtemper of the bloud, the ancients were wont to let the patient bleed to ſwouning: which is not to be underſtood of thoſe who are afraid of bleeding, or if it happen through ſome other cauſe beſide that extraordinary bleeding; but when it happens only by reaſon of the evacuation; ſuch a kinde of bloud-letting as this they uſed in great inflamations, burning Feavers, and extreme pains. And <hi>Galen</hi> affirms that he hath found by experience, that if in burning Feavers the patient bleed to ſwouning, that preſently the whole habit of the body is cooled, and the Feaver extinguiſhed: and that many by looſneſſe and ſweating have been clearly reſtored to health. But this evacuation to ſwouning in our time is little in uſe; and by the vulgar blemiſhed by the name of raſhneſſe. And therefore it is beſt to ſtop, and to draw as much bloud as would bring the patient to ſwoun at two or three times without any fear of ſwouning, and leſſe hurt to the natural ſtrength.</p>

                     <hi>Cauſes alſo external and internal coindicate the quantity of bleeding.</hi>

                     <hi>A very fat habit of body very hardly ſuſtains bleeding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though ſuch a habit be not ſubject to diſſolve, yet becauſe it hath narrow and ſlender vens, which when they are emptied, the fat eaſily ſtraightens, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leſt it extinguiſh the natural heat, and therefore is prejudiced by bleeding.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe ſuch a Countrey conſumes much of the natural heat, bloud, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whence the ſtrength is conſumed, and leſſe quantity of bloud is left in the veins.</p>

                  <p>A cold and moiſt temper of the air, keeps in the humours and the natural heat, and diſſolves them not, but in a very cold countrey the bloud being as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, hardly gives way to evacuation, then the internal parts if they remain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of their heat, are in danger to be extinguiſhed by the ambient cold.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:153522:167"/>
                  <p>As to the ſeaſons of the year, the Spring permits moſt bleeding, next Autumn, then Winter, leaſt of all Summer.</p>
                  <p>In the moſt hot and moſt cold poſture of the heaven, the bloud is to be ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let forth, in a temperate more plentifully.</p>
                  <p>Any accuſtomed evacuation ſuppreſſed, requires a larger emiſſion of bloud.</p>
                  <p>A voluntary evacuation that takes not away the matter of the diſeaſe, doth not exclude bleeding, ſo the ſtrength be not much impaired thereby; but in reſpect of this, the bloud is to be let out more ſparingly, and the evacuation to be ſuppreſſed, if it will more impair the ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Spontaneous evacuation, if it bring away the morbifick matter, if it do eaſe the patient, and is able to void as much as you require, you muſt then leave it to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if that be not able, you ſhall vacuate ſo much bloud, as that both evacuations joyned together may be able to do the work.</p>
                  <p>They that live frugally and ſparingly, either out of cuſtome, or by reaſon of ſome diſeaſe, are more ſparingly to be let bloud, then thoſe that live more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are accuſtomed to bleeding, bear it with leſſe danger, then thoſe who are not accuſtomed to it.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch diſeaſes as require bleeding, there you muſt let bloud at the beginning. The time of letting bloud is ſhewn by the preſence of thoſe Indicants, that require ſuch a remedy: for in the beginning of a diſeaſe thoſe Indicants do chiefly concur, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, and of the ſtrength which then is more vigorous, alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature in the progreſſe of the diſeaſe, being intent upon concoction and its contention with the diſeaſe, is not to be called away from her work.</p>
                  <p>If the beginning of the diſeaſe be omitted, or that then ſufficient quantity of bloud hath not been taken away, it is to be let forth at other times, if the ſigns of fulneſſe and crudity ſtill appear, and the ſtrength can bear it, and that other coindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants concur, or at leaſt hinder not.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe things which forbid bleeding at the beginning of a diſeaſe and at other times, crudity of the ſtomack is not the leaſt, or the inconcoction of the meat in the firſt veſſels.</p>
                  <p>This precept is propounded by <hi>Galen,</hi> 9. <hi>Meth. c.</hi> 5. therefore unleſſe the diſtemper of the bloud be very vehement, bloud-letting is to be deferred, till thoſe humours be concocted, leſt being drawn to the liver they ſhould beget obſtructions, and ſhould do more harm then bloud-letting could do good.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe diſeaſes where there is either a certain remiſſion or intermiſſion, Bloud-letting may be uſed either ie the remiſſion or intermiſſion. In the fits and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Feavers, there is the greateſt conflict of nature with the diſeaſe, at which time nothing is to be ſtir'd, nor is the ſtrength required for the conflict to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by bleeding, which is elegantly expreſſed by <hi>Celſus c.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 2. in theſe words: <hi>If a vehement Feaver urge, in the very vehemency thereof to let bloud, is to kill the man.</hi> When an affection urges vehemently, a vein is to be opened at any hour, but in thoſe that intermit, the fitteſt time to let bloud is the morning, two or three hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun-riſing.</p>
                  <p>For then the meat eaten the day before is well concocted, and the ſtrength is more vigorous: alſo in the morning the bloud is more full of power and is more thin and apt to flow.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Purgation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>PUrgation, <hi>is an evacuation of the humours peccant in quality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This definition is propoſed by <hi>Galen, Comm. in</hi> 2. <hi>Aph. ſect.</hi> 1. which that it may be rightly underſtood, you muſt know, that by vice of the quality is not meant a meer diſtemper; for to that alteration only were ſufficient; but rather a Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymie, or a redundancy of evil humours. Of this ſort are all excrementitious humours, which being mixed with the bloud are contain'd in the veins or without them: but thoſe are of two ſorts, others natural, others preternatural. Natural, are thoſe which are generated according to nature, as ſweet flegm, choler, melancholy, and the ſerous humour; which if they are generated in due proportion and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, need not any vacuation; but if they abound in greater quantity, are to be purged out, but the excrementitious humours which are preternatural, are thoſe which are produced contrary to nature; as yellow, green, eruginous, glaſteous, and black cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; as alſo ſharp and ſalt flegm; which humours when they ought by no means to be in the body, the leaſt quantity of them breeds a Cacochymia, and indicates purgation, if it cannot be removed by diet, exerciſe, and lighter labours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to every ſpecies of the peccant humour there ought to be correſponding a proper ſpecies of purging medicine. And ſo for flegm, medicines that purge flegm; for choler, medicines purging choler; for melancholy, things that purge melancholy; for the ſerous humour, things that purge aqueous and watry humours; and for mixt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, mixt medicines are to be uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Purgation is coindicated by the ſtrength, temperament, habit, age, ſex, manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the patient, and by the ſtate of the air.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all purgation it is neceſſary that the ſtrength of the patient ſhould be very luſty or moderate.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrength is ſomething impaired by purging; and therefore if it be very much weakned, purging is not to be attempted.</p>
                  <p>Hot and dry bodies, as alſo cold, whether they be moiſter or dryer, endure pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation very hardly; hot and moiſt, more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which are endued with a hot and dry temperament, by purgation may be eaſily heated, rarifi'd and dry'd; and alſo fall into convulſions, if the purgation be overmuch. Cold and moiſt, and cold and dry, have a faint heat, and little ſpirits, which are eaſily diſſipated by purgation; but hot and moiſt have a greater heat to reſiſt the force of purging: a thin, tender and looſe habit is eaſily diſſolv'd, but a fleſhy and well compact tolerates purgation; but a fat habit, not ſo well.</p>
                  <p>Fat people are diligently to be diſtinguiſhed from fleſhy, for although both may endure purgation, yet much leſſe the fat, becauſe they are colder, and have leſſe ſpirits, and narrower veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Boyes and old men, require gentler medicines, in their middle age more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
                  <p>Women with childe, in the 4, 5, and 6 moneth upon urgent neceſſity and with great caution may be purged.</p>
                  <p>This is to be taken from <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. and it agrees with reaſon. For when nature ſtirred up by the purging medicine, endeavours to expel the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humours, and the diſeaſe it ſelf; it ſhakes the womb, and expels the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:153522:168"/>birth, unleſſe it ſtick very cloſe; but if when ſhe is with childe ſhe is troubled with a diſeaſe that requires purgation, it muſt be uſed but with milde and gentle reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and the more confidently in thoſe moneths wherein the birth is more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to the womb, which is in the 4, 5, &amp; 6. moneth. For as <hi>Galen</hi> elegantly ſaith, the adhering of the birth to the womb is like the hanging of the fruit upon the trees. For the fruit at firſt is held on with more tender ſtalks, and therefore more eaſily fall off when the wind ſhakes them; but being grown bigger they are not ſo eaſily looſened from the boughs: and again, when they are ripe they fall of of themſelves. So the birth at the firſt beginnings of its formation, and when it comes to perfection, are more eaſily ſhaken forth, but in the middle time they cling faſter to the womb.</p>
                  <p>The particular nature of the patient is diligently to be obſerved, for ſome are purged eaſily and plentifully by weaker medicines; others are hardly moved by ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are accuſtomed to purgations more eaſily endure them, but in thoſe who are ſeldome or never purged, we muſt proceed more cauriouſly.</p>
                  <p>In a hotter or colder air purgations are more difficult, in a temperate more eaſie.</p>
                  <p>A hotter air weakens the ſtrength and begets hot diſeaſes, and therefore admits not purging, which impairs the ſtrength. Therefore ſaith <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> in the dog-daies and before them 'tis bad purging.</p>
                  <p>The cold condenſes the humours, and ſtops up the paſſages, rendring the body leſſe fluid, which makes purging leſſe ſucceſſeful. Therefore <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 47. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. ſaith that purging is better in the Spring then at any time of the year.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of the purge is ſhewn by the quantity of the vicious humour; for it is all to be purged out, that the body may be freed. If the noxious humour be not wholly taken away, the diſeaſe is not cured; or if it appear cured, it is ſubject to a relapſe. Therefore <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>Thoſe things which are left in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, cauſe relapſes:</hi> but if but a little portion of that humour be left, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite diet, by nature and the natural heat it may at length perhaps be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall Cacochymie may be drawn all away at one time, if the ſtrength be vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and the matter be concocted and thin; but if the ſtrength be impaired, both a ſmall and great Cacochymie is to be drawn out by degrees.</p>
                  <p>This Theorem is confirmed by that of <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 36. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>Thoſe that eat bad meat, if they purge, they loſe their ſtrength thereby.</hi> The reaſon is becauſe they abound with many and vicious humours, and have little good juice, ſo that their weak ſtrength is much waſted by a ſtrong medicament; and then that ſink of ill humours being mov'd by the purging medicins, ſends ſtinking and ill vapours to the heart, ſtomack and brain, which do cauſe ſwounings, giddineſſe, and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: yet theſe humours are not to be left in the body, but to be purged out by degrees and at ſeveral intervals of time, and by Epicraſis without much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt fit time for purgation, is at the height or declination of the diſeaſe, in which the humours are concocted and prepared for evacuation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule is founded on <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 21. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>Phyſical cures belong to concected, not to crude things.</hi> But in the declination of the diſeaſe, or at leaſt at the end of the height thereof they are perfectly concocted. This Theorem is to be limited with this reſtriction, <hi>viz.</hi> if nature do not perform evacuation of it ſelf. For when the humours are critically evacuated, there muſt be then no purgation, unleſſe the criſis
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:153522:169"/>be imperfect. For then the reliques of the morbifical matter are to be drawn forth by medicines, leſt they breed a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of diſeaſes purgation is to be uſed, if the humour be too ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and ſwell.</p>
                  <p>The humours are then ſaid to ſwell, when they are agitated with violence, and provoke and pain the body. But this ſwelling is proper to cholerick humours, which are hot, thin, and acrimonious, and moſt ſubject to breed acute diſeaſes. But thick and cold humours which generate long diſeaſes, are not wont to ſwell ſo much. If therefore ſuch humours ſwell, it is lawful to purge them forth before they are concocted; for it is to be fear'd that the ſtrength may be impaired by the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, and that the humours ſtirred up by that violence may fall upon ſome principal part: but then thoſe humours are eaſily purged; although they be not concocted, becauſe being thin and movable, nature being alſo excited by them, and provoked by the purging medicins, lends her helping hand to evacuate them her ſelf. So that the patient receives more good then harm by the purging away of thoſe ſwelling humours, before they are concocted. Whence, <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. <hi>It is good to adminiſter cure in acute diſeaſes, if the matter ſwell, the ſame day, for to delay longer in ſuch diſeaſes is evil; but this is to be performed with caution and premeditation, for the moſt part the matter ſwels not;</hi> as in <hi>Aph.</hi> 22. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. and as the ſame <hi>Hipp.</hi> teaches in <hi>Aph.</hi> 24. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>In acute diſeaſes and at the beginning ſeldome uſe purgations, but with premeditation:</hi> for purgations by their heat, and acrimony increaſe acute diſeaſes, and acute diſeaſes are ſooner waſted by a critical evacuation then by purging. But thoſe Criſes are not raſhly to be diſturb'd, but rather if there be any hope of them, abſtain from purgation, and means rather are to be conſidered of and prepared for that evacuation. The ſtrength alſo and other coindications are to be obſerved: as alſo the body it ſelf, if the paſſages thereof are open and free from obſtructions, and that the patient do not abound with a multitude of thick and crude humours, and alſo that he be not oppreſſed with any inward inflamation, which would be worſe by purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Humours that flow to the more noble parts, or thoſe parts that have a relation to the nobler parts, or that are about to flow thither, are to be purged away in the beginning of a diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Some deep wounds, ulcers, inflamations and other tumours, head-aches, and other affections of other parts, if ill humours do abound in the body, no doubt but purgation is very convenient, if there be nothing elſe to hinder it, that the matter cauſing the affection may be diminiſhed and called from that part, which is uſed in ordinary practiſe, and confirmed by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his book of curing by Phleb. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>In thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who have any part vehemently afflicted, or by any other way hath a flegmone growing on, if we ſuſpect it will be very great, we begin to cure it by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, purges, or breathing a vein, as we ſee which is more convenient then the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the humours abound in quantity, and therefore cannot be well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, part of them is to be purged away, that nature may the better deal with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this kinde of purgation diminiſhes the morbifical matter by taking away ſome part thereof, therefore it is commonly called <hi>Minorative,</hi> which in our times is for the moſt part uſed in all diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the dangers objected by the enemies to minorative purgations inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the beginnings of diſeaſes very formidable: for they fear that the matter
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:153522:169"/>being moved and not evacuated, may caſt the patient into any evident danger, and that the humours bad and good ſhould be mingled together.</p>
                  <p>Which dangers are moſt eaſie to be avoided, if more gentle medicines, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to common practiſe, be uſed, which purge the firſt region with little or no commotion, and bring away the morbifick matter diſpoſed to evacuation. Now if theſe purgations were leſſe uſed in the times of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipp.</hi> which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the beginning of diſeaſes, the reaſon was, becauſe in thoſe times only vehement and malignant medicines were applied; thoſe more milde and gentle medicines, which to us are familiar, being not known to them, which may be uſed without any trouble. Therefore <hi>Celſus</hi> in a Feaver forbids purging, becauſe the purges of thoſe times by their fiery heat and acrimony did increaſe the heat of the Feaver: And for that reaſon <hi>Hipp.</hi> in the ſummer did abhor theſe medicines, as <hi>Aph.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>In the dog-daies or before, purgation is naught;</hi> becauſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are burnt up at that time, and cannot brook the acrimony of the purging remedies; and for the ſame reaſon we in our ages do avoid thoſe hot medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are called <hi>diagridiate,</hi> in thoſe hot ſeaſons, and in Feavers; but gentle ones which are a little hot, and for the moſt part temperate, nay ſome of them coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both in continual Feavers and in their beginnings, in the ſummer, and in the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, are by us uſed ſucceſſefully. Notwithſtanding 'tis moſt certain that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the beginning of diſeaſes permitted purgation, eſpecially in diſeaſes not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, and in which there was not a crudity of humours ariſing from putrefaction. As <hi>Galen</hi> 4. <hi>devict. rat. in morb. acut.</hi> ſaith that he hath exhibited a Purge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the ſecond, ſometimes on the fourth, ſometimes on the fifth day. And again <hi>lib. de comp. med.</hi> ſometimes without concoction, or any other precedent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he purges both kindes of choler, and flegm in an Alopecia, as alſo a little after in many diſeaſes of the head. Laſtly, 13. <hi>Meth.</hi> he relates, that many who have had an inflamation in the eyes have been in one day cured by purging through the lower part of the belly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In diſeaſes that have exacerbations and paroxyſms, it is more ſafe to give a Purge in the day of remiſsion or intermiſsion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when the diſeaſe troubles leſſe, the ſtrength is more vigorous, and endures the vehemency of the diſeaſe. Notwithſtanding in the fit, evacuation is made more readily, becauſe then the humours are in motion, and as it were ſwelling, and ſo more diſpoſed to be carried away. And therefore Empericks are wont to cure intermitting Feavers, by exhibiting medicaments that evacuate by vomit or ſtool, or both. But becauſe nature is much afflicted this way, therefore a prudent Phyſician ought ſeldome, and with very great caution to try ſuch kinde of cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To a free elective purgation, a temperate day, the South rather then the North wind blowing, with a benevolent poſition of the ſtars, is moſt conducing to health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Southern conſtitution of the air renders the body looſer, and the humours more fluid, which makes purgation more ſucceſſeful. But that the ſtars are to be obſerved in purging, the Aſtrologers do teach; and you may ſee all their precepts numbred up together into one head by <hi>John Antonius Maginus,</hi> in his Book <hi>of the lawful uſe of Aſtrologie in Phyſick.</hi> And firſt you muſt obſerve not to purge in a conjunction of the Moon and the Sun, nor in an oppoſition. For although this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with others of the Aſtrologers be derided, yet it is obſerved, that at thoſe times purging proceeds not ſo ſucceſſefully, as at others; and therefore in an elective purgation, 'tis better to avoid thoſe Aſpects.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:153522:170"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The place through which purgation is to be made is twofold, by vomit and ſtool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it is diſcovered by the place and nature of the humour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humours reſiding in the ſtomack are commodiouſly purged away by vomit, as alſo not ſeldome thoſe which are contained in the ſpleen, hollow of the liver, and in the pancreas. But thoſe which reſide in the lower parts, or parts remote from the ſtomack, are purged away through the belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Evacuation by vomit, is moſt convenient for the humours contained in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, yet 'tis certain that the parts near the ſtomack, as the liver, ſpleen, and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas are ſometimes evacuated by vomit; ſo that ſometimes moſt obſtinate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours breeding long diſeaſes, are ſucceſſefully evacuated this way from thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which cannot be eradicated by other remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thin, hot and cholerick humours by vomit; flegmatick, and melancholy, and thick humours are more eaſily purged by ſtool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cholerick humours fly upwards being light; flegmatick and melancholy fall downward, becauſe they are heavie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The place through which purgation ought to be made, is coindicated by the time of the year, habit of the ſick, nature and cuſtome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the ſummer 'tis more convenient to purge upward, in the winter down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This precept is ſet down by <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. and the reaſon of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yellow choler, and hot humours abound in the ſummer; and are more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried upwards; but in the winter the contrary happens. Neither is it repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this opinion which <hi>Hipp.</hi> obſerves <hi>li. de Salub. diat.</hi> that in the ſix winter moneths vomiting is to be uſed; For that is explained by <hi>Galen</hi> to be only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of flegm, which is collected in the ſtomack, for that is to be purged away by vomit, but the reſt of the body by ſtool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who are of a ſlender habit, are more eaſily purged upward, but thick and fleſhy people downward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Theorem is taken from <hi>Aph.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. and the reaſon is, becauſe lean people are more cholerick, fleſhy people more flegmatick. Beſide that theſe through the weight of the caul and muſcles of the abdomen, cannot vomit but very laboriouſly and violently, and with much danger of breaking ſome veſſel in the breaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who have a diſpoſition prone and eaſie to vomit, by theſe vomiting may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily endured; but thoſe that vomit difficultly muſt not be permitted to vomit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are not prone to vomit, cannot be made to vomit but by very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment medicines, which endangers a ruption of ſome vein in the breaſt through ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe who are accuſtomed to vomit, may the more eaſily be purged by vomit; but they who uſe it not, difficultly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vomiting was much uſed among the Ancients, for which cauſe they endured more vehement vomitories. But in our times that cuſtome is out of uſe; and therefore the greater warineſſe is to be obſerved in giving vomits, and good heed muſt be taken to know when vomiting may be uſed, when purging, and which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. For nature her ſelf hath made a way through the guts, to the ejection of excrements; and therefore hath made them leſſe noble, and indeed the way is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtraighter from the whole body to the guts, then to the ſtomack, and many more and greater veins are carried to the guts then to the ſtomack.</p>

                     <hi>The preparation of humours is made by art, concocted by nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concoction, is the alteration of the ſubſtance into a better condition, which is done by the force of heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this conco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion differs from alteration, that alteration changes the qualities, and concoction the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is twofold, the one is called</hi> pepſis, <hi>the other</hi> pepaſmos.</p>
                  <p>Pepſis <hi>is that true and proper concoction, which changes the nouriſhment into the ſubſtance of our bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pepaſmos, <hi>is when a vicious and putrid humour, which cannot be changed into the ſubſtance of the body, is changed into ſomething better and more convenient to nature, as into purulent matter, or ſomething like to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tumours ariſing from bloud are changed into true purulency, as alſo the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which is generated in ulcers. But putrid humours which are contained in the veins, are not converted into true matter, but into ſomething elſe of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an example whereof is ſeen in the ſediment of Urine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The preparation of humours which is made by art, reſpects either the humours themſelves, or the waies through which thoſe humours are to be purged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hot humours are to be refrigerated, cold humours are to be heated, thick humours are to be cut and attenuated, glutinous and clammy humours are to be cleanſed, thin ones to be thickned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though many imagine contrary to <hi>Avicen,</hi> that the humours the thinner they are, are ſo much the more eaſily purged, and are never to be thickned; yet it is more agreeable to reaſon, that they ſhould be moderately thickned. For as chaffe is blown here and there by the winde, ſo ſaith <hi>Avicen,</hi> the cholerick humour through its lightneſſe, being agitated here and there, is not eaſily brought away by medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or expelled by nature, till it be moderately thickned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The way through which the humours are to be purged, muſt be made open and free, and the ſtomack alſo to be without any nauſeouſneſſe, leſt it ſhould be averſe to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, and vomit it up again. The guts muſt be alſo emptied, leſt they reſiſt the courſe of the humours, and the obſtructions of the bowels muſt be opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Any preparation which is made by art, and help of remedies, is uſed not only to help purgation, but alſo to promote concoction of the morbiſick humour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the morbifick humour being weakned by the preparing remedies is more eaſily overcome by our heat, and brought to a Pepaſmos; therefore theſe preparing medicaments, by the Phyſicians, though improperly are called concocting, becauſe they conduce to the alteration and concoction of the morbiſick humours.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>BY Urine are evacuated the ſerous and cholerick humours, and the thinner flegm from the whole body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though in the ordinary works of nature a watry humour is only evacuated, as the ſuperfluity of drink; as alſo the gibbous part of the liver, reins, bladder, and the veſſels ſerving to them are purged more commodiouſly thoſe waies: Yet ſometimes the whole body evacuates ſome thinner humours by thoſe paſſages, as we ſee in Criſis performed by Urine with good ſucceſſe. And therefore the Phyſician muſt promote theſe evacuations with fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In thoſe diſeaſes chiefly, whoſe matter is to be evacuated by degrees, and by little and little evacuation is to be performed by Urine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Diuretick medicines evacuate the body but by little and little, and therefore they profit not ſuch in diſeaſes that want preſent evacuation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When evacuation is performed by Urine, heed is to be taken, leſt the humour which is to be brought away be much and plentiful; for it is to be feared that while the humour is compelled to the narrow paſſages, it ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them by its redundancy, and ſhut up the paſſages both to themſelves and others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Phyſicians before they uſe Diureticks, bring away a good quantity of the peccant humour by ſtool, and afterwards evacuate the reliques by Urine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the reins, bladder, or other veſſels deſtin'd to this uſe are inflamed, or any ſuch like way affected, vacuation by urine is not to be uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe it is againſt reaſon to bring the humours to the part affected and weak.</p>

                     <hi>BY Sweat may be purged forth, whatever thin humours or that are ſubject to be made thin are contained in the habit of the body and veins; or may be brought to thoſe parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this evacuation, nature and the operation of the Phyſician ſeems contrary. For nature critically diſſolves only acute diſeaſes by ſweat, but the Phyſician en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours the cure of chronical diſeaſes by this evacuation. The reaſon is, becauſe ſweat cannot be provok'd by art without heating the body, which is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in acute diſeaſes; but in long and cold diſeaſes it is profitable, becauſe thereby the flegmatick humours fixed to the parts, are attenuated, and by little and little brought away.</p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:153522:171"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That evacuation which is made by ſweat, the ſtrength impaired, a hot temper and cholerick, and multitude of matter will not permit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the uſe of Sudorificks, the pores of the skin are opened to the great damage of the ſpirits and ſtrength. By the ſame ſudorificks the body growes hot, ſo that it is to be feared, leſt the hot diſtemper ſhould caſt the patient into a Feaver, or Conſumption. Laſtly, while the matter is much, being agitated all together, and vehemently attenuated, it is to be feared that it ſhould fall upon ſome principal part, or ſhut up the pores of the body, which cauſes putrefaction, tumours, and other diſeaſes. And therefore it is the beſt way before the provocation of ſweat, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the morbifick matter with univerſal purgation.</p>

                     <hi>EVery diſtemper is to be corrected by alteration, which is to be performed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a hot diſtemper points to a cooling Medicament, a cold diſtemper a heating Medicament; a moiſt diſtemper, driers; a dry, moiſtners: ſo in compounded diſtempers, hot and moiſt diſeaſes, require cold and dry medicins; hot and dry, cold and moiſt; cold and moiſt, hot and dry; cold and dry, hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A more intenſe diſtemper and more remote from the natural temper of the body, wants ſtronger medicines; a more remiſſe, and leſſe remote from the natural temper, requires more remiſſe medicines.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In correcting any diſtemper, the part affected muſt be accurately conſidered, the remedies applied muſt be appropriate and ſpecifical, having a peculiar affinity with the diſeaſe, and agreement with nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when the brain is to be heated, we muſt not apply indifferently any

                  <p>
                     <hi>OF an organical diſeaſe, there are many ſorts,</hi> viz. <hi>in conformation, magnitude, number, and ſituation, whoſe ſeveral Indications are diſtinctly to be propounded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes of conformation are in figure, in paſſage, cavity, roughneſſe or ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The figure is viciated, either in the womb, or after the birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That error which is contracted in the womb, may be omitted as incurable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which happens afterward, if it be of a long time, is hard to be cured; if late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, much more eaſily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the depravation of the figure be produced by an afflux of humours, or by any other cauſe external or internal, by the removal of thoſe cauſes, it will be amended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the depravation of the figure, which in preternatural tumours, and the faces of leprous perſons, and ſuch like appears, it is to be reſtored by the revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, derivation, or evacuation of the humours cauſing thoſe effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the depravation of the figure happen without the afflux of humour; as in thoſe who have crooked legs, or bunch backs, or their ribs one higher then another: In chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren it is to be amended by often ſtroking, then by lying on the oppoſite ſide, and by ſwathing and paſteboards. In thoſe that are more grown, by ſoftning medicines to be mollified, and then to be contain'd in its due place by the means mentioned. But if disfiguration happen by ſome fracture, or ill bred calloſity, cauſed by the undue collocation of the member, the callous part is to be cut away, that it may be made to grow more handſomely, if it may be done without danger, that is, in a ſtrong well diſpoſed and temperate body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes of the cavities and paſſages, are dilatation, aſtriction, and obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are wont to be produced by innumerable cauſes, and according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of cauſes, they have many ſorts of Indications, which cannot be handled but in a particular method.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roughneſſe and ſmoothneſſe that are preternatural, proceed from many cauſes, both internal and external, wounding, gnawing, cleanſing, drying, and the like, the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of which muſt be in a particular method.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſeaſes in number, are only to be cured by nature, for that which is wanting is either fleſh, bone, or ſome other part which the Phyſician can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add; yet he may help the generation thereof removing the impediments which delay nature in her work. As alſo when the members are loſt which cannot be recovered be nature, yet the Phyſician may ſuborne ſomething in ſtead thereof, which may ſupply in a manner the uſe thereof; as when an iron arm or a wooden leg is put in the place of that which is loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatever exceed in number are preſently to be cut away, ſo it may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, and to the advantage of the patient, but as there is very great variety in this
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:153522:172"/>this particular, ſo the way of cure is manifold, yet all is performed by iron, fire, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As it is ſaid before, A remedy as it is the inſtrument of curation, is indicated by things preternatural, and coindicated by things natural: So now it is certain, that nouriſhment as it is the inſtrument of conſervation, is indicated by things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to nature, and coindicated by things averſe to nature.</p>
                  <p>But the ſtrength is the faculties themſelves, or rather the inſtruments of them, that is, the vigour of heat, ſpirits, and the ſolid parts; which being firm and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the ſtrength is vigorous; and ſo on the contrary: ſince therefore the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſolid and ſpiritous parts, is by the benefit of the nouriſhment, therefore the uſe of it, which is called Diet, is ſaid to preſerve the ſtrength. But the diſeaſe, or the morbifick cauſe doth coindicate or forbid the uſe of nouriſhment, as that may be increaſed or fomented by it; or nature intent upon Pepſis, may be called away by Pepaſmos; for when nature is buried in the concoction of nouriſhment, ſhe is drawn away from concocting the morbifical humour, whence upon conſideration of the diſeaſe, regard muſt be had to the meaſure of dieting.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Meat and drink, as they are the true objects of nouriſhment, ſo are they the true inſtruments, which preſerve the ſtrength; but other things which are not natural, are only the helping cauſes, which being well or ill diſpoſed, produce good or ill nouriſhment from the meat; for ſleep and watching, if they are exceſſive, hurt the heat and ſpirits, if they are within the limits of health, they preſerve them and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward concoction; immoderate ſleep cools and moiſtens the brain, ſo that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat waſtes, the animal ſpirits are ſunk in moiſture, and the animal faculty is injured, with which the vital and natural do eaſily ſympathize. Over much watching diſſipates the heat and ſpirits; but moderate ſleep, and moderate watching, preſerve the heat and ſpirits, and ſo forward concoction. So motion and reſt, if moderate, excite the natural heat and cheriſh it: repletion and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo, being orderly, makes a very good concoction. But paſſions of minde, if they be moderate, make the natural heat vigorous, and a good concoction; but the exceſſe of them diſſipates the natural heat and ſpirits, or choaks them. Laſtly, the ambient Air, being temperate, recreates all the functions of the body, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, very much prejudiceth them, and hinders the cure of diſeaſes.</p>

                     <hi>DIet is threefold, full, moderate, and ſparing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Full, is that which not only preſerves the preſent ſtrength, but increaſes it. And that is threefold, the one most ſimple, which is convenient for the ſick, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to</hi> Hipp. <hi>and conſiſts of whole barly-broth; another fuller and thicker, which conſiſts of fiſh and eggs; the laſt fullest of all, which conſiſts of more ſolid fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sparing diet, is that which preſerves the ſtrength, though ſomething impaired. This is threefold, one ſimply ſo, which is by the juice of unhusked barly; another ſort thinner, which conſiſts of water and hony; and the laſt moſt ſparing of all, which is meer faſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moderate diet, is that which preſerves the ſtrength in the ſame condition, and was heretofore by bread in pottage, or fleſh of pullets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now a daies the diet of ſick people is very different, and never any thinner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed then broths of pullets and chickens.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The diet of ſick perſons is to be proportioned by comparing the ſtrength with the diſeaſe. For by how much the more nature is imployed in the expelling of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſo much the ſparer diet is to be obſerved as the ſtrength is able to bear it, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:153522:174"/>the leſſe work nature hath to do, a more plentiful diet may be offered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In long diſeaſes a moderate or full diet is requiſite, and ſo much the fuller, by how much the diſeaſe is longer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſtrength is to be preſerved that it may endure, and prevail in the expelling of the whole diſeaſe, which becauſe it may laſt long, it is not to be diminiſhed by ſparing diet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acute diſeaſes require a ſlender diet; and by how more acute the diſeaſe is, ſo much the ſlenderer ought the diet to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In acute diſeaſes, nature is imployed in expelling the diſeaſe, and therefore as little as may be to be diſturbed by nouriſhment, and therefore a thin diet is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; which although it do a little impair the ſtrength, yet it is able to bear up the whole courſe of the diſeaſe which is very ſhort.</p>
                  <p>If the ſtrength is not ſo well known to the Phyſician, as to preſcribe a juſt diet, it is better to preſcribe an over full then an over ſparing diet.</p>
                  <p>This precept is taken from <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>Through a ſlender diet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient growes faint, which harms them more; for what error is committed, is greater in a ſlender then a fuller diet: and therefore an exact diet is dangerous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in health; for that by reaſon thereof, they bear errors in diet worſe.

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE quantity of Diet is threefold, high, indifferent, leaſt of all; which may be uſed in all ſorts of diet, full, moderate, or ſparing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in Medicaments, there is a threefold quantity or doſe, <hi>viz.</hi> higheſt, midling, and loweſt, which are conſidered in more vehement, more milde, and more indifferent ones, ſo is it in diet. And after the Phyſician hath judged, whether a thin, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or full diet be moſt convenient for the diſeaſe propoſed, then he ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether they ought to be adminiſtred in the higheſt, loweſt, or midling quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; which he may diſtinguiſh by the acuteneſſe of the diſeaſe, or the greater or leſſer ſtrife of nature with the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of a diſeaſe the diet moſt requiſite, is to be given in a full doſe.</p>
                  <p>For then nature contends not ſo much with the diſeaſe, nor is yet imployed in the concoction and evacuation thereof, and therefore can make uſe of more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                  <p>In the increaſe of the diſeaſe, diet is to be given in a moderate quantity.</p>
                  <p>For then nature is employed in the concoction and evacuation of the morbifical matter more then in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the height of the diſeaſe the ſlendereſt diet is to be given.</hi>

                  <p>For then the contention of nature with the diſeaſe is moſt vehement, and ſhe is very buſie in the concoction and evacuation of the matter, and not to be called away from her imployment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the ſtrength be impaired and the morbifical matter very oppreſsive, the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be given in a little quantity and often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the cauſe which is very vehement, little nouriſhment is to be given, leſt the morbifick cauſe be increaſed. But in reſpect of the ſtrength it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite often to reiterate it, leſt the ſtrength be deficient; where there is great prudence required in the Phyſician, who ought to obſerve all things indicant and coindicant, or prohibiting, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> notes, <hi>Aph.</hi> 17. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>Regard is to be had to whom we may give once or twice, more or leſſe, and by intervals, wherein ſome reſpect is to be had to age, countrey, and cuſtome.</hi>

                     <hi>IN continual Diſeaſes that are not differenced by acceſsions, or exacerbations, Diet is to be given according to cuſtome at that time chiefly at which the patient was wont to eat before.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In diſeaſes that have acceſsion or exacerbations, nouriſhment is to be given in the intermiſsions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when the force of the diſeaſe is moſt vehement in the fit, and the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature with the diſeaſe moſt fierce, then nature is not to be burdened with aliment, nor to be diverted from its work to the concoction of meat.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, nouriſhment given at that time is not concocted but remains raw, and is corrupted by the putrid matter which is agitated in the fit, whereby the diſeaſe is increaſed, and evil ſymptomes generated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When there is the greateſt loſſe of ſtrength, though in the fit, nouriſhment is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to be given.</hi>

               <p>IN the cure of internal Diſeaſes, the principal Indications reſpect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the morbifick cauſes, or the diſeaſes, or the parts affected.</p>
               <p>The morbifical cauſes are for the moſt part various humours, which as they are peccant in ſeveral qualities, ſo they require ſeveral Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments endued with contrary qualities. Thus cold humours require hot medicines; hot, refrigerating ones; thin, incraſſating; thick, attenuating; corrupt, purging, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Diſeaſes ſometimes remain after the taking away of the cauſe, and require a peculiar curation by contrary remedies: as is fully explained in <hi>the general Method of Curing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the parts require ſpecifical medicines to corroborate and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as Cephalicks, Thoraticks, Cordials, Stomachicals, Hepaticals; all which we ſhall ſet down in their order.</p>
               <p>Moreover all this matter is taken either out of plants, roots, woods, barks, leaves, ſeeds, fruits, flowers, gums, reſins, liquors, juices, or from whole animals and their parts, as well living as not living, and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious; and laſtly from Minerals which are earths concrete juices, ſtones, and metals, out of all which ſeveral compounds are made in the ſhops, as waters, ſyrups, conſerves, powders, troches, confections, electuaries, pills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>THE cholerick humour as often as it produces any diſeaſe, requires cooling medicines; but when it is thick and fixed to any part, then not only refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating medicines, but alſo gently attenuating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Refrigerating Medicines come in to uſe, as indication is taken from the diſeaſe or the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Choler is hot and produces hot diſeaſes, ſo that refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration is neceſſary for both. Attenuating remedies are to be uſed almoſt in all Feavers, eſpecially thoſe which proceed from a putrefaction of the humours. For all putrefaction is cauſed by the hindrance of tranſpiration, tranſpiration is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by obſtruction, obſtructions are produced by the multitude and thickneſſe of the humours.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as ſome putrid Feavers are cauſed by multitude of humours, ſo the greateſt part of them is accompanied with a thickneſſe of the humours; which if it be not ſo much eſpecially in choler, as to obſtruct the open paſſages, yet it is ſufficient to ſhut up the inſenſible pores of the internal parts: which that they may be opened, the humour is to be prepared by at leaſt gently attenuating medicines. To this add, that ſometimes choler is fixed to ſome part, which that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it is to be attenuated, and to that uſe medicaments refrigerating and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating choler were deſtin'd; which though they are cold, have a certain tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſubſtance, which they manifeſt by a ſlight ſharpneſſe and bitterneſſe, and by that they attenuate the humours.</p>

                     <hi>IN many paſſages of the body; eſpecially the veins of the Liver, Meſentery, and Womb, obſtructions are bred from thick and clammy humours, which adhere to the tunicles of the veſſels, and hinder the paſſage of the other humours.</hi>

                  <p>In cold natures, ſedentary people, and ſuch as uſe bad nouriſhment, crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are generated, which being carried to the narrow paſſages, cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their craſſity paſſe through, but are more and more thickned, and become more clammy and glutinous, ſticking to the tunicles of the veins, and begetting obſtructions there which brings along with it infinite miſchief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thoſe obſtructions are opened by aperative medicaments, which according to</hi> Galen, 5. de ſimpl med. fac. c. 11. <hi>are of a nitrous and bitter quality, by the help of which quality they attenuate, cut and cleanſe, and ſo are near a kin to thoſe medicaments that prepare flegm.</hi>

                  <p>Opening Medicaments, are by <hi>Galen</hi> called purging, and unſtopping Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which faculty all thoſe medicines are endued, which are moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the taking away of obſtructions, for by their attenuating quality, they take away the thickneſſe of the humour; as they cut, they take away the clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which conſiſts in the tenuity of the parts; and as they cleanſe, they ſhake off the humour adhering to the parts.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of purging Medicaments.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HItherto we have propoſed thoſe Medicaments which prepare noxious humours; and make them fit for purgation: now we treat of thoſe medicines that purge them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The humours are uſually evacuated, by ſuch purging Medicines, as having a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the ſubſtance of them draw the humours to them, as the loadſtone drawes iron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore there are ſo many ſorts of purging medicines, as there are ſorts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the body fit for purgation, that is choler, flegm, melancholy and water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The humours which are evacuated by the help of purging Medicaments, are choler, flegm, melancholy, and the ſerum or watry humour, to every one of which there are peculiar remedies electively purging. So thoſe that purge choler are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cholagogues;</hi> flegm, <hi>Phlegmagogues;</hi> melancholy, <hi>Melanagogues;</hi> the ſerous humours, <hi>Hydragogues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are again divided into milde, moderate, and vehement remedies.</p>
                  <p>All purging Medicaments work not with like force, but ſome with leſſe, ſome with greater, according to their various power of acting allowed them by nature: and therefore that their vertues may be the eaſier drawn forth to uſe, they are divided into three ranks, milde, moderate, and vehement. Milde Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments are commonly uſed in weak natures, or where the firſt region is only to be evacuated. Moderate in a moderate condition of the ſtrength, and to evacuate the ſecond Region. Laſtly, the moſt vehement in ſtronger bodies, and when the humour is to be attracted from the remoter parts, as the brain, joints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But commonly a wary Phyſician in the ſame medicament mingleth vehement with milde and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that they may work the more ſucceſſefully together.</p>
                  <p>And for the better uſing of them the juſt dole of every one is to be propounded.</p>
                  <p>'Tis of very great moment, rightly to underſtand the doſe of every Medicament, without which no man can make a medicine without the apparent endangering the life of the patient. But becauſe the doſe of purging Medicines, is to be changed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various diſpoſition of the bodies, which wholly depends upon the judgement of the Phyſician; we will therefore propound a greater and leſſe doſe, as they are uſed in a moderate age; that from their latitude a convenient quantity may be diſcerned.</p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:153522:180"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thoſe Doſes are ſo to be taken, according as the Medicaments are taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or (as they ſay) in their ſubſtance. For in infuſion there is uſed a double quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the vehement remedy, in decoction a troble; but thoſe more milde and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, are commonly trebled in the infuſion, and quadruple in the decoction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vertue of Medicaments is loſt by infuſion and decoction; for that remains in a thin ſubſtance, which is eaſily diſſipated by the heat; and therefore the force of the heat being much ſtronger in decoction then infuſion, it followes that the purging faculty is more diminiſhed, and therefore a greater doſe of the Medicine to be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>From this general Theorem, are excluded Rhubarb, and Myrbalans, which purge more in infuſion, then in the ſubſtance; becauſe they have not only a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but a binding quality, which is loſt by infuſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two medicaments obtain a purging and aſtringent faculty by reaſon of their various ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> thin, and thick, or earthy. For the purging faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the thin ſubſtance; in the earthy, the binding quality. Now in infuſion the thin ſubſtance is carried into the liquor, the earthy rejected, ſo that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging faculty only remains in the confuſion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of vomiting Medicaments.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE noxious humours contained in the ſtomack and parts near it, oft-times are more eaſily evacuated by vomit, then by ſtool, if the patient be more prone to it; to which uſe thoſe Medicaments are deſtined, which are called</hi> vomitory.</p>
                  <p>Oft-times excrementitious humours ſwim in the ſtomack, which are expelled a ſhorter way by vomit, eſpecially if the patient be troubled with nauſeouſneſſe, and be ſubject to vomit; for cholerick, ſlender, and large breaſted people eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure vomiting, according to the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> on the contrary, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, fleſhy and narrow breaſted people are more vexed by vomiting, eſpecially if they are troubled with a conſumption, Aſthma or any other affection of the lungs. To this may be added the time of the year; for in the ſummer, purgation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is more eaſie; in the winter, not ſo: but although the uſe of theſe remedies is not very frequent, yet 'tis certain, that being uſed opportunely, they produce ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects; for we have ſeen many intermitting Feavers that have reſiſted all other remedies which have been cured only by vomitories.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe medicaments provoke vomiting either by a manifeſt faculty, by looſening the ſtomack, or by ſome ſpecifical property, as purging.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever are fat and oily, taken in great quantity, do looſen the ſtomack, and ſubvert it, which cauſes vomiting; by which thoſe things are only evacuated that are contained in the ſtomack. But thoſe things which are properly called vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories by an occult quality, attract the humours to the ſtomack, and excite it to an upward expulſion. And ſo the humours contained in the Liver, Spleen, and parts adjoyning to the Stomack, are not ſeldom happily evacuated.</p>
                  <p>The choice and moſt in uſe are theſe:</p>

                     <p>The doſe of them is not ſet down, becauſe it is better never to uſe them through the danger, which the vehemency of them may cauſe, or at leaſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accurate preparation and correction.</p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:153522:182"/>
                     <p>The Chymicks abound with vomitory Medicaments, and thoſe for the moſt part ſo vehement, that for their ſakes all ſpagyrick remedies are ſuſpected among the vulgar. Of this ſort are thoſe which are compounded of Antimony; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>glaſſe and flower of Antimony,</hi> which I never durſt hitherto uſe, though I have been willing to try the effects of Spagyrick Remedies, and their force in phyſick. For it is not to be denied, that ſome Spagyrick Remedies prudently uſed by the Phyſician, have that ſucceſſe which vulgar remedies cannot produce. And therefore it will not be amiſſe briefly to declare thoſe Spagyrick Vomitories which have been known to do good.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are four, in vertue and effects very various, which whoſo will uſe theſe remedies cautiouſly ought to have ready at hand, that he may proceed from thoſe leſſe vehement, to thoſe more ſtrong, if the others prove not ſufficiently effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is <hi>white Vitriol prepared,</hi> as is preſcribed by <hi>Crollius</hi> and <hi>Beguinus,</hi> which is ſo gentle a vomit, that it is ſafely given to children from ℈ ſs. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. to thoſe that are more grown, to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. diſſolved in common water; it evacuates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the humours contained in the ſtomack, but nothing from the other parts.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Salt of Vitriol,</hi> extracted out of Cyprian Vitriol calcin'd, which works more vehemently then the former, it evacuates the ſtomack only. The Doſe thereof is from gr. x. to gr. xx. diſſolved in ordinary water. It is deſcribed by <hi>Beguinus</hi> under the name of <hi>Sal Colchotar;</hi> and by <hi>Angelus Sala in Triumpho Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum,</hi> and in his <hi>Anatomy of Vitriol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is <hi>Aqua benedicta,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Quercetanus</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacopoea,</hi> it is compounded of Antimony, and is more vehement then the firſt, and is not to be given but to ſtrong men, and that with great caution: but if it be ſeaſonably uſed it produces rare effects. The Doſe of this water is from ℥ j. to ℥ iij. it draws humours not only from the ſtomack, but from the whole body.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is <hi>pulvis Emeticus,</hi> which is vulgarly called <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Beguinus</hi> and <hi>Crollius,</hi> it is more vehement then any before named; yet it may have its uſe in the cure of obſtinate diſeaſes, and which reſiſt the force of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary medicins; yet it muſt be cautiouſly uſed, and when the ſtrength is no way impaired; it removes the humours powerfully from all parts of the body. The Doſe is from gr. iij. to v. in Broth, conſerve of Roſes, or any ſuch thing. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of this <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> may be corrected, ſo that it may be given in greater quantity, and may hardly, or very little, provoke vomiting; and may perform its work downward. Many waies of correcting it are to be ſeen in <hi>Hartmannus,</hi> in his <hi>Commen. upon Crollius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This we add approved by our own experience, which purges downward in many ſick people, in others cauſes vomiting once or twice only. This correction of ours is moſt eaſie, which is done by putting <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> well waſhed in a porrenger glas'd with earth upon a chafingdiſh alwaies ſtirring it. A black &amp; ſtinking fume ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales, which contains venome that lurks within; which in two or three hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales quite away, continuing the labour of ſtirring it. And then the work is done when it hath done evaporating. If after the operation it move vomiting, it is to be repeated, and it will work the deſired effect. The whiteſt powder by this cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obtains a gray colour; it may be given from gr. iiij. to gr. viij. reduced into a tablet with ſugar and mucilage of tragacanth, that it may be adminiſtred without nauſeouſneſſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Sudorifick Medicaments.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IN Chronical and contumacious diſeaſes, Sudorificks are often uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe diſeaſes which cannot be cured by altering and purging Medicaments, but are deeply fixed, ſuch as are Epilepſies, Palſies, obſtinate Catarrhs, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Gouts, and any cold affections, and eſpecially the Pox, require more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicaments to eradicate them, ſuch as are Sudorificks; which being uſed for many daies, as the cuſtome is, not only purge the third Region, for which they are moſt proper, but alſo the whole body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They being endued with a heating and attenuating faculty, melt the humours and drive them out through the inſenſible paſſages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The humours cauſing long diſeaſes, are for the moſt part cold and thick, and therefore Sudorificks are moſt convenient for them; which heat thoſe humours, melt and attenuate them, open the inſenſible paſſages of the body, and evacuate the humours through them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But many things move not ſweat ſo much by any manifeſt quality, as by a ſpecifical property.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This opinion is not among the ancient Phyſicians, for they refer'd all the force of Sudorificks to manifeſt qualities, neither were theſe excellent Sudorificks which are now known to us, known to them; yet it is neceſſary to acknowledge an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult quality in them, by which they provoke ſweat; when as Pepper, and wilde Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which are hot and attenuating, do not move ſweat; yet China root, in the firſt qualities ſomething temperate, doth effectually.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sudorificks are theſe:</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BY Diuretick Medicaments are conveniently purged the gibbous parts of the Liver, the Reins, Bladder, Womb, and the whole ſtock of the veins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the effects oppreſſing the veins, are known by the Urines, becauſe part of the matter contained in the veins is carried to them, alſo the ſame effects often ending by that Criſis, which is made by a Perirrhoea; ſo the noxious humours are the more eaſily purged away by Diureticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of theſe ſome are hot, ſome cold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The hot by melting the humours, ſeparate the more watry and ſerous parts which are afterwards attracted by the reins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Medicines which are properly and truly called <hi>Diuretick,</hi> are ſharp and vehemently hot and dry, therefore they drain the bloud and ſeparate the ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from it, they alſo melt flegm and thick humours, and change them into a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try humour, which is eaſily mingled with the ſerous humour, and is together at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the reins, and expelled with the Urine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the cold ones ſometimes by cleanſing, and ſometimes by increaſing the watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, move urine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Medicaments cleanſe the humours that are contained in the veſſell and reins, and do a little attenuate them, becauſe although they are cold, yet they have thin parts, and ſo do move urine. Such are <hi>Graſſe, Aſparagus, Pellitory of the wall, Maiden-hair, &amp;c.</hi> Many other things are endued with a moiſture, which is afforded to the veins, and afterwards attracted by the reins, with which the humours in the veins are carried along. Of this nature is <hi>Marſhmallowes, Cucumers, the greater cold Weeds.</hi>

                  <p>THE action of the ſtomack is offended many waies, either in not deſiring nouriſhment, or ill concocting it, or by not retaining it duly.</p>
                  <p>The appetite is ſpoiled, when the ventricle, and eſpecially the upper orifice thereof, is ſtopped with any excrementitious humour. The concoction is hurt, by a diminiſhing of the heat of the ſtomack. The retention thereof is weakned by a looſneſſe of the part which is ſucceeded by vomiting and ſcowring.</p>
                  <p>The appetite is raiſed by Medicaments which cleanſe away the noxious humours, preſerving the ſtrength of the part, and by a gentle griping of the part, cauſe a feeling of divulſion, ſuch are things ſharp and ſalt. Some things help concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſpecifical property, others by a moderate heat and Aromatical vertue.</p>
                  <p>The retentive faculty is confirmed by proper aſtringents.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtomachical Medicaments are alſo either hot or cold.</p>
                  <p>The functions of the ventricle, as alſo of the other parts, are hurt by divers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, which indicate generally the removal thereof, and therefore among the ſtomachicals thoſe are to be choſen, which as they corroborate the part, ſo alſo they ſerve for the general indication, correcting this or that diſtemper.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe things which help conception, refreſh the womb with a moderate heat, and recreate it by an aromatical vertue, and confirm it by a kinde of aſtriction.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things which exclude the birth and ſecundines, haſten the months alſo, but the ſtronger of them are to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things which move the months, are hot and of thin parts, yet they dry not very much, neither do they attenuate only the bloud, but alſo open the mouths of the veſſels.</p>
                  <p>There is a great affinity between thoſe things which move the months, and Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; but they are in this diſtinguiſhed according to <hi>Galen,</hi> 5. <hi>de ſimpl. med. fac. c.</hi> 22. in that both are hot, but Diureticks powerfully dry, which thoſe things that move the months do not. For thoſe things which dry more vehemently, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the bloud, and ſo ſteal away the matter from the months, as alſo thicken it, and make it leſſe commodious for flux. Yet they help forward the profuſion of urine; for while the bloud melted by the heat, is thickned by the dryneſſe, there muſt be a ſeparation of the ſerous ſubſtance, which affords matter for urine.</p>
                  <p>Medicaments hindring the flowing of the months, either ſhut up the paſſages by a binding quality, or hinder the flux by thickning the humours.</p>
                  <p>Every immoderate flux, proceeds either from a looſneſſe of the paſſages, thinneſs, and movable nature of the humours, and therefore by binding up thoſe paſſages, or by the humours acquiring a thickneſſe and clammineſſe, it is eaſily hindred.</p>

                  <p>Things that increaſe Milk, have the ſame qualities with thoſe things that move the moneths, though as to the effects theſe do ſeem much contrary to the other; for as often as the months are excited to flow, ſo often is the generation of milk impeded. But in this they differ, that thoſe things which move the months are hotter then thoſe things which increaſe milk, and more attenuating. For in the generation of milk, there is an expulſion of the bloud to the breaſts; and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from the ſame, but in the vacuation of the months, there is only an expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the womb; ſo that the bloud ought to be more attenuated, and the remedies botter and dryer, ſo <hi>Gal. c.</hi> 21. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de med. fac.</hi> will have Dill, Fennel, and Rocket, as being green and moiſt herbs, moſt proper to increaſe milk, but being dry to move the months; becauſe then they do heat and dry more.</p>

                     <hi>WHatever Medicaments are bitter, ſharp, ſowr, aſtringent, or oily, are good to kill the Worms.</hi>

                  <p>Bitter, ſharp, and ſowr things, with their tenuity pierce the ſubſtance of the worms and diſſolve them; Aſtringents, by ſhriveling them up together: Oily Medicaments by ſtopping their pores hinder tranſpiration, by which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they live, and ſo they choke them. Yet 'tis moſt certain, that there are ſome Medicaments which kill the worms, not only by manifeſt qualities, but by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical property. For example, Mercury, which only applied to the belly in oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, effectually kils the worms in the guts; and being inwardly and in due quantity taken, and rightly prepared, it works wonders. Alſo raw Mercury, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for ſome time in fair water, communicates its vertue in ſome meaſure to it, ſo that the fair water be ſo uſed as ordinary drink, is very efficacious to kill the worms.</p>

                  <p>All theſe kinds of hardneſs happen to our bodies.

By the multitude of humours, the parts are ſtretched and repleted. Laſtly, humours na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally cold, and deſtitute of proper heat, or ſetling in a part labouring with a cold diſtemper, condenſe of themſelves and harden.</p>
                  <p>That hardneſſe which ariſes from dryneſſe, is cured by humectation; that which comes by repletion, is cured by evacuation; that which comes by concretion, is taken away by thoſe things which are properly called Emollients.</p>
                  <p>Now true and right Emollients, are very like to Anodynes; endued with a moderate heat and dryneſſe, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> 5. <hi>de ſimpl. med. fac. c.</hi> 8. being

                     <hi>SUppurating Medicaments are moderately hot and moiſt, and like to the temper of the part to which they are applyed, and ſo they increaſe the natural heat thereof, where by the putrifying bloud is concocted and changed into true purulency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our bodies there uſe to be but three ſorts of alterations, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> 5. <hi>de ſimpl. med. fac. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>One</hi> is plainly natural, when the meat is concocted for nouriſhment in the ventricle, liver, and other parts. The <hi>other</hi> is wholly preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, when the ſubſtances contained in the body contract putrefaction. The <hi>third</hi> is partly natural, partly preternatural, and is called <hi>Suppuration.</hi> For when the bloud contained in the part, by contracting a putrefaction, hath obtained a preternatural heat, it is altered and concocted by the natural heat of the part, ſo that both heats working together, neither a perfect concoction, nor abſolute pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction is produced, but a middle operation, called Suppuration, by which the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:153522:196"/>humour is not made fit for nouriſhment, but is reduced to a certain moderation of ſubſtance and qualities, more conſentaneous to nature. But now the Medicaments which promote ſuppuration are thoſe, which increaſe the natural heat, and cauſe it to be more vigorous in exerting its ſtrength. Such are thoſe which have a heat like that heat of the part to which they are applyed; and ſo cheriſh it and make it more vigorous.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe are very like emollient Medicaments; yet diſtinguiſhed in this by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s teſtimony, that Emollients are hotter and dryer, and ſo conſume ſome of the humour contained in the part; but ſuppurating Medicaments being more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, keep in the whole moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuppurating Medicaments being exactly ſuch, ought to be Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, for that the heat may be retained in the part, the pores thereof ought to be obſtructed, leſt a diſſipation ſhould be made through them: now it is proper for emplaſtick Medicaments to ſhut up the pores.</p>

                     <hi>This they perform by moderately drying and gently cleanſing the filth of the ulcers; therefore they are to be moderately hot and dry, and void of all acrimony; for if they were hotter, and more acrimonious, they would melt the fleſh; if cold and aſtringent, they would cicatrize the wound before the ulcer were filled with fleſh.</hi>

                  <p>It is the proper office of nature to generate fleſh by the aſſimilation of the nouriſhment, but <hi>Sarcotick</hi> Medicaments cannot perform that of themſelves, but only help the action of nature, removing the impediments; for filth and ſuperfluous moiſture abounding in an ulcer, are wont to hinder the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fleſh; hence by gently drying and cleanſing Medicaments, the ulcer is purified, and diſpoſed for the action of nature endevouring the generation of new fleſh.</p>

                  <p>Therefore it is twofold, Altering, and Purging.</p>
                  <p>An altering Apozeme is compoſed of roots, barks, woods, leaves, ſeeds, fruits, and flowers, the quantity of which is uſually as followes:</p>
                  <p>Of Roots, ℥ iiij. or vij.</p>
                  <p>Rinds, ℥ j. or ℥ ij.</p>
                  <p>Woods, the ſame quantity.</p>
                  <p>Leaves, m. v. or viij.</p>
                  <p>Seeds, ℥ j. or ℥ j. ſs.</p>
                  <p>Of leſſer fruits, as Raiſins, ℥j. Sometimes they are meaſured by number, to 12. or 16. pair; but greater fruits are meaſured only by number, and that even, as figs, to 7 or 8 pair; but the greateſt fruits by uneven numbers, as Apples.</p>
                  <p>Of Flowers, iiij. or ſix pugils.</p>
                  <p>All theſe are boyled in ſufficient liquor, which is commonly fountain, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times barly water, as in cholerick affections, or thin hydromel, as in flegmy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſometimes in obſtructions a decoction is made in equall parts of fountain water and white Wine, added at the end, or in two parts of fountain water, and one of white Wine, according to the judgement of the Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of the liquor is not ſet down, but is preſcribed in this manner, <hi>Let a decoction be made in a ſufficient quantity of fountain water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the quantity of a ſtreined decoction ought to be ſet down, <hi>viz. ad</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr> j. for three doſes, five quartaries for four doſes, <hi>ad</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr> j. ſs. for five doſes in this manner, <hi>of the ſtrained liquor take</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr> j ſs.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the ſyrups are diſſolved in ſuch quantity, ſo that for every doſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozem ℥ j. of ſyrup in this manner, <hi>in which (v.z.</hi> colature) <hi>diſſolve</hi> ſyrup, <hi>viz.</hi> of Violets or Maidenhair, ana ℥ ij.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Sugar is preſcribed in the ſame doſe, eſpecially when any juices are
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:153522:200"/>diſſolved which make the Apozem more efficacious. Now thoſe juices are very commendably preſcribed in an Apozem to ℥ ij. in this form, <hi>in the ſtrained liquor diſſolve of the purified juices,</hi> viz. of Borage or Sorrel ana ℥ j. white Sugar ℥ iij. but for the moſt part the quantity of Sugar is not defin'd, but it is thus preſcribed, a ſufficient quantity of white Sugar.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus done, an Apozem is ſometimes aromatized to make it more pleaſant; but the moſt frequent and gratefull ſpices, are Citrine, Sanders, Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Triaſantali in a cooling Apozem; Cinamon in a heating Apozem; and the doſe of theſe ſpices is <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. ſs. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. in this form, <hi>Make a clarified and aromatized Apozem;</hi> as for example, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. of choice Cinamon, for iiij.

                  <p>A <hi>Purging Apozem is that which not only prepares the humours, but alſo evacuates them with one and the ſame labour, purging Medicaments being mixt with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kinde of Apozem is now very much and almoſt only in uſe; for that which ſimply alters, is commonly uſed by the name of a Julep.</p>
                  <p>And it uſes to be fourfold, according to the fourfold difference of Catharticks, <hi>viz.</hi> Cholagogue, Phlegmagogue, Melanagogue, and Hydragogue.</p>
                  <p>It is compoſed of the ſame amtter with altering Apozems, and after the ſame manner, only Catharticks are added with their correctives, and they are placed among the fruits and flowers in ſuch a proportion, that there ſhould be ſo many doſes of Catharticks, as of the Apozem.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt uſeful to preſcribe Sena as the foundation of every ſuch Apozem, for the moſt part to ℥ ij. to wh ich are added Polypodium, and ſeed of wilde Saffron in the ſame quantity, or at leaſt to ℥ j. of each; then other Catharticks are preſcribed according as the peccant humour requires, of which ſome are wont to be decocted, as Turbith, Hermodactyles, Agarick, Epithymum, black Ellebore, ſeed of Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, and others are infuſed, as Rhubarb, Agarick, Tamarinds.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe which are not decocted but only infuſed, ought to be preſcribed in this form; as for example of Rhubarb infuſed by it ſelf,, ℥ ſs. but thoſe which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, muſt be ſimply ſet down: but the computation of the doſes ought to be ſo made, that one doſe of Sena in decoction, ſhould be ℥ j. of Turbith, Hermodactyles, and Agarick ℥ ſs. Rhubarb infuſed alſo ℥ ſs. but of Polypody, ſeed of wilde Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, and Epithyme, there is no accompt to be had, becauſe they are of ſmall vertue.</p>
                  <p>So when we compoſe an Apozem into four doſes, we may preſcribe ℥ ij. of Sena, Turbith, and Agarick, ana ℥ ſs. for ſo there will be four doſes of purgers, <hi>viz.</hi> two of Sena, one of Turbith, and one of Agarick, in the place whereof we may put others as the indication requires, the ſame method being ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Correctives are preſcribed preſently after the enumeration of all the purges which for the moſt part are Ginger and Cloves; of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtreined decoction are diſſolved the ſame ſyrups for the moſt part which are preſcribed in altering Apozems; ſometimes alſo, when the Apozem is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:153522:200"/>to be not ſufficiently purgative, purging ſyrups are diſſolved, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive, ſometimes ſyrup of Cichory compoſed with Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, in cholerick affections, and ſyrup of Fumitory compounded with Rhubarb in melancholy affections: ſometimes in the ſpring time juice of white Roſes is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or an infuſion of them is made to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iiij. in cholerick affections, and then no ſyrups are preſcribed, but only Sugar q. ſ.</p>
                  <p>But this is to be obſerved in the uſe of all Apozems, firſt that in the beginning, the humours contained in the firſt region be evacuated by a purgative Medicament, and that in the end the reliques of the humours be removed, which is very often done, if the firſt and laſt doſe thereof be made to purge more ſtrongly, diſſolving in it, of Opiate or purging Electuary, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. more or leſſe according to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patient; of purging ſyrup <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. after this form, <hi>In the firſt and laſt doſe diſſolve</hi> of Electuarium Diacarthamum, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Sometimes in affections of the head, and parts very remote from the ſtomack pills are preſcribed after the Apozem, and then nothing is diſſolved in the laſt doſe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>APotion is a liquid form of a Medicament to be preſcribed for one doſe, compoſed of the decoction, infuſion, or diſſolution of ſeveral things in fit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                  <p>This is manifold according to the various indications, in which it is uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> purging, corroborating, provoking ſleep, killing the wormes, helping parturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A purging potion is many waies prepared; and in this three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, 1. Decoction, 2. Infuſion, 3. Diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſual decoction is deſcribed partly of Sena to ℥ ſs. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> v. Aniſe ſeed <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. to correct the Sena, or Aniſe ſeed and Cloves, <hi>ana</hi>

                  <p>Or elſe the common purging decoction is to be uſed, which is uſually had in the ſhops.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in affections of the Creſt, the ſame pectoral purging decoction is uſed after the ſame method.</p>
                  <p>The infuſion is made of Rhubarb in cholerick, of Agarick in flegmie affections, or of both in mixt, and their quantity is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. ſs. correctives being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>viz.</hi> Spikenard, or Cinamon, or citrine Sanders, from gr. vj. to ℈ ſs.

                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:153522:201"/>
                  <p>The liquor wherein the infuſion is to be made, is diſtilled water proper to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or elſe the foreſaid purging decoction.</p>
                  <p>In diſſolutions, compound purgers are to be preſcribed, Opiates, or Electuaries in various doſes, according to the leſſe or greater quantity of the purgers, which were preſcribed in decoction, and infuſion, and ſome purging ſyrup, as ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive moſt frequently; ſometimes ſyrup of Cichory compounded with Rhubarb, or compounded ſyrup of fumitory, which purges leſſe then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſyrup: the quantity of the ſyrup perpetually is ℥ j. ſometimes in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lungs, Manna is diſſolved from ℥ ſs. to ℥ i. and then the quantity of the ſyrup is diminiſhed to ℥ ſs.</p>
                  <p>In theſe various manners are purging potions compounded, <hi>viz.</hi> either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe three preparations, or two, or one only.</p>
                  <p>Of the three preparations, various forms are compoſed, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the decoction, or infuſion.</p>
                  <p>For if a magiſterial decoction be to be made with infuſion, the form of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in that decoction ſhall be thus, ℞ fol. ſenae, &amp;c. <hi>make a decoction</hi> to ℥ iij. <hi>in the Colature infuſe</hi> of Rhubarb, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. ſs.

                  </p>
                  <p>But if a magiſterial decoction be to be made with an infuſion in diſtilled water, it is to be preſcribed after this manner, ℞ <hi>make a decoction</hi> to ℥ iij. <hi>in the Colature diſſolve</hi> of Rhubarb infuſed in water of Cichory with Spike and preſſed out, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j.

                  <p>If it be to be made of a ſhop decoction with an infuſion in diſtilled water, the preſcription is to be made after this manner, ℞ Rhubarb Elect, and Agarick Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſchat. <hi>ana</hi> ℈ ij.

                  <p>Note that ſometimes no Electuaries are preſcribed, when the Purge is gentle, but only common decoction and ſyrup.</p>
                  <p>Potions compoſed only of two preparations, are twofold, either by decoction and diſſolution, or by infuſion and diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Of decoction and diſſolution are made Potions after this form, ℞ &amp;c. <hi>make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> to ℥ iij. <hi>in the Colature diſſolve</hi> of Electuaries, &amp;c. ſyrup, &amp;c. <hi>mingle them and make a potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By infuſion and diſſolving are made potions after this form, ℞ of Rhubarb, &amp;c. <hi>les them be infuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when they are ſtreined diſſolve</hi> of Electuary, &amp;c. of Syrup, &amp;c. <hi>mingle them, and make a potion.</hi>

                  <p>Altering ſyrups are compoſed by the Phyſicians very ſeldome, becauſe there are ſo many ready in the ſhops upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>And therefore magiſterial altering ſyrups, are never or rarely preſcribed, but only thoſe in the ſhops are uſed, and that two waies, for either they are diſſolved in other liquors, or elſe they are adminiſtred alone.</p>

                  <p>SUdorifick Decoctions are commonly compoſed of the four principal Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, Guaiacum, Saſſafras, China roots, Sarſaparilla, of which as well ſudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick as ſimple diets are compoſed.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of ſudorificks is preſcribed to iiij. or vj. and that of one or more according to the diſpoſition of the ſick party: with this obſervation, that Guaiacum is fitter for cold, China root for hot diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they are infuſed in a ſufficient quantity of fountain water, that for every ounce of ſudorifick there ſhould be ſo many <abbr>lb</abbr> of water; but infuſion is made for 24 hours upon the hot cinders, and laſtly they are boyled to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of half.</p>
                  <p>The doſe of the decoction is ℥ viij. in the morning, covering the body a little more then ordinary, to provoke ſweat more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>The form of preſcribing them may be thus, ℞. <hi>Of the ſhavings of Guaiacum</hi> ℥ iiij. <hi>bark of the ſame,</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>infuſe them</hi> 24 <hi>hours in</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The remaining part is taken either alone, or that it may be the more efficacious, add to it ℥ j of new ſudorifick.

                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:153522:204"/>Then the Bochet is to be made of ℥ ij. of ſudorifick infuſed and boyled in <abbr>lb</abbr> xij. of fountain water, ordering the reſt as in the ſecond decoction, in this form: ℞. <hi>of the root of China cut into chips</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>infuſe them in</hi>

                  <p>In every ſudorifick diet, this is to be <hi>obſerved,</hi> that the belly is for the moſt part part bound, which is to be looſened every fourth day with an emollient Clyſter.

                  <p>AN Epithem is chiefly applyed to the heart and liver, to alter and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>It is twofold, liquid, and ſolid.</p>
                  <p>That which is liquid is made of diſtilled waters to ℥ viij. or <abbr>lb</abbr> j the juices of fruits, as Limons, Granates, fragrant Apples to ℥ ij. or iij. of vinegar of Roſes to ℥ j. or ℥ j ſs. of cordial powders to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. iij.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> when ſharp juices of Limons and Granates are preſcribed, there is no need of vinegar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note</hi> alſo in an Epithem for the Heart, if the lungs be peculiarly affected, ſharp things are not to be preſcribed, becauſe they hurt the breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in an Epithem for the Liver a greater quantity of ſharp juices or vinegar is to be preſcribed then in an Epithem for the heart.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes beſide cordial powders, cordial confections are alſo mixed with them, Alkermes, or Hyacinth, to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. or ij. and Troches of Caphura in a refrigerating Epithem to ℈ ſs. Saffron in a heating Epithem, to gr. v.</p>
                  <p>The form of preſcribing them is thus: ℞. &amp;c. <hi>Make a liquid Epithem to be applied to the region of the heart lukewarm, frequently with ſcarlet clothes dipped and ſqueezed in this liquor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:153522:209"/>
                  <p>The ſolid Epithem is only applied to the heart, and is compoſed of cordial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to ℥ iij. conſections ℥ ſs. powders <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. ſs. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. with convenient cordial water.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This ſolid Epithem is not ſeldome preſcribed alone, where there is a greater neceſſity of corroborating then altering. The liquid one is never applied, but the ſolid one muſt be applied after it preſently. Therefore the Phyſicians uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the liquid and ſolid one one after another, adding in the end of the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>make a ſolid Epithem to be applied to the region of the heart preſently after the liquid one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Epithems are referred the younger ſorts of Animals diſſected in two through the middle, ſprinkled with cordial powders, and applied to the region of the heart. Thoſe animals are Pigeons or Whelps: the form of preſcribing them is thus: <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the region of the heart a young Pigeon cut in two in the middle, and ſprinkled with powder of cold Diamargarite Electuary.</hi>
